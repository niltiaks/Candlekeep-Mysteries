[Sylvia](Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[India]]'s old friend, a bard named [[James]] Buffet, good friends from school (nothing more)
- His carriage was attacked by a goblin troupe, asked us to help
- Came across glade where goblins were dancing around a fire, playing a lute poorly and singing
	- Queen goblin in dress with sparkly wand
	- [[James]] told us the lute was his, as well as other instruments not in sight, maybe in the tent?
	- Fought goblins, [[Adriel]] and [[James]] went to retrieve his instruments from the tent
	- [[Adriel]] gathered 21gp, 429sp, 867cp and a variety of trinkets and some clothes
		- 18gp each to party members
- Rode the rest of the way to Argentis Falls, got some gossip from [[James]]. See NPC spreadsheet for details
- Arrived at Silver Lodge, folks were setting up for the wedding
- The "happy" couple were taking part in a ceremony for engaged couples where they tie themselves to each other with 7 bracelets and make promises for each bracelet that they wear in marriage
- Ceremony began to end as we were about to split up to congratulate the couple
