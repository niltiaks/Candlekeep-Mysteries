#Zikran-Tome 
[Sylvia](Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Woke up after long rest, [[India]] noticed a long creature burrowing into the ground over the night from a distance.
	- The creature [[India]] saw was likely at least 25 feet long
- Heard the sound of crushing ice but it sounded far enough away that we didn't need to worry about it yet, so we carried on up the mountain
- Later, [[India]] heard something shuffling in the ridges as we were walking between them. [[Adriel]] saw a draconic wing on one of the ridges and misty stepped up to it.
	- Turned out to be a group of flying kobolds, fought them off and continued up the mountain
- The Hills Have Eyes - [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) and [[Stalfor]] noticed some icy rock with seemingly beady eyes, very far off in the distance. Maybe being watched?
- Stopped for the night, [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) took first watch and heard thingies burrowing in rocks, she woke the party as they burst out of the cliffside (frost salamaders)
