#Kandlekeep-Dekonstruktion #Downtime 
[Sylvia](Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Adriel]] ditched us and flew home to Waterdeep.
- Went to the Hearth, and Fheminor Schrivenbark (a halfling master sages) walked in with a dragonborn with staff and an elven woman with wand.
	- Told us that the three of us had done a service for Candlekeep and are free to go, we are welcome back to Candlekeep (at least in the Court of Air) without donations required.
- Left for Waterdeep
	- Took private carriage to Baldur's Gate, then transferred to another private carriage at BG to Waterdeep
	- Fought some Wyverns on the road but made it to Waterdeep with horses and carriage driver unharmed.
