# Session 100 Notes
- Yawning Portal was bumpin after [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md)'s show
	- Corner with people getting tatted
	- People selling merch outside
	- Harlots swarming [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) who he was trying to disband and send away subtly
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) went outside to buy some merch and came back inside wearing it, [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) asked her to go outside to make sure he gets a cut of the merch
	- She went outside to try to ask the man to give [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) a cut, he claimed to know [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) and promised he would get a cut
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) didn't trust him so she offered to work the merch stand with him to keep an eye
	- Promised her first customer a meeting with [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) and said as soon as they were done selling all of the merchandise she would introduce him, he ran off to get money to buy out the stand to meet [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) faster
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) didn't come back inside so [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) and [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita) came outside to see what was going on, she explained to him she didn't trust the merch seller so she was keeping an eye on him
	- Meanwhile that first customer came back and said he got his 50gp LIFE SAVINGS to buy out the stand to meet [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md). [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) was like noooo, keep your money.  He said can you bring it back to my house its heavy. She said yes of course. He said his address was **19 Tarnath Street in the North Ward** (I think)
	- The merchant tried to scram but [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) sent out a fire giant to collect the money, let [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) keep the 50gp that the man brought and asked [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) to make sure it gets back to him
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) sat inside by the fire which coincidentally was near Gwendolyn who had a conversation with [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md)
	- She dropped a BOMB on [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) that they had a kid together and left crying
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) followed her outside, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) sent out her familiar behind to listen
	- Learned that he has a son named Laurien Silverstrings, toddler, silvery hair, pale skin
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) was very supportive and asked if he could meet Laurien, also revealed that he was a changeling
	- He made a plan to meet Laurien and came back inside, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) was like "are you okay"
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) hit her with a Modify Memory, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) knew what he was doing but didn't stop him if that's what he wants she won't stop him
		- He removed all memory of the outside conversation and replaced it with [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) getting three ales from the bar and chugging them
- Explained the [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) situation briefly to [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita) who offered potions of fire resistance, will only last for an hour each
	- Bought 10 potions, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) paid for it (20gp per potion)
- The party went their separate ways for the night
	- [Orianna](NPCs/Living/Greed.md) and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) got a room
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) got a room
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) went home by herself <3
