- Started session in Hag hovel
- Dryads said they had a third friend in the other building
- Investigated other building, saw 18 cages with various animals and creatures in the cages.
- Freed the dryads, they said they'd come back to deal with the animals but [India](PCs/Current/India.md) just let them all out anyway.
- Went north, found edge of forest.
	- East - dense forest
	- West - well-worn trail
- Went west, river took sharp turn to the north and red lightning flashes to the south
- Turn south towards lightning
- Heard gruff voices growling and roaring
	- Cheering for someone called the "Beast Lord"
	- Lots of animal carcasses?
- Killed berserkers and headed back to the lightning

- Found spring, there were five werewolves and a cultist standing around the pool which is corrupted
- [[Adriel]] failed some wisdom save and disappeared, replaced by a wolf
- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) died and a werewolf ran off with her
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) died to emo unicorn
