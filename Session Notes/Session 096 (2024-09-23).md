# Session 95 Notes
- Searched the area:
	- Robes, mostly handcrafted, not magical, but very nice
	- Nice staff of dark, gnarled wood, crowned with an obsidian shard
		- Staff of immense power passed down through her druidic order
		- Grasp of decay - Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
			- A twisted, thorned staff made of ebony crowned by an obsidian shard
			- A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of circle of the unbroken wilds leaders.
			- While holding this staff, the wielder gains a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls, and their spell save DC increases by 3.
			- The staff has 20 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.
			- While holding the staff, the wielder can expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using their spell save DC and spellcasting ability:
				- Tasha's Caustic Brew (1 charge)
				- Life Transference (3 charges)
				- Animate Dead (3 charges)
				- Evard's Black Tentacles (4 charges)
				- Enervation (5 charges)
				- Eyebite (6 charges)
				- Finger of Death (7 charges)
			- While attuned to the staff you have advantage on constitution saving throws vs magic effects.
			- Whenever you deal damage with a necrotic spell, regain 1d10 hp
			- You're immune to poison and disease while attuned to Grasp of Decay
			- Plants of CR 2 or lower are not hostile to you

	- Said that Riff and Raff were looking for Adriel but he vanished, then they got to talking with [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) and he could offer better pay and benefits so he gave them Belts of Reduce and some jobs as bouncers
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) had a 1:1 and you could cut the tension with a knife
		- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) lip read about half of [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md)'s side of the convo and relayed to [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) and [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md)
