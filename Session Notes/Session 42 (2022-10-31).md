- Countdown says 22:30
- Wireframe projections showing areas of the tower - we see murdered cultists
- Console bolted to the ground
- Gnome scrambling around, looking for something
- Locked safe in the corner

- Opened safe, three separate ivory goat statuettes
	- Beast of burden (packs on it)
	- Strange proportions, rearing back
	- Brutal horns carved on it

- Heroes Feast cookbook ([Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) kept)
- Trobrian's machinations, vol. 10 (stalfor)
- Stonky Noptopper spells o'plenty ([[Adriel]])
	- Smaller book, jam packed with spells

- Killed Stonky and stopped the ship from taking off
- Told authorities on the way out and they asked us to stay while they sort it out in case they need us for the investigation but refused to put us up in the hearth while we wait!!! >:(
