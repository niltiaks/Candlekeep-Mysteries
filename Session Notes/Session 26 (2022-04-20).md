# Session 26 Notes
- Last session we left Waterdeep to head to the Spine of the World to investigate [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) family thing
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) bought a clockwork amulet and a few potions
- On the journey we passed a bridge troll and an overturned cart. We have completed 5 days of travel
- Last session ended with us setting up camp.

- During travel we came across a sign pointing into the woods saying "Magical Spring! Come Relax and Wash Your Worries Away"
	- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Current/India.md), and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) investigated.
	- At the end of the path has a rickety structure with a bunch of sketchy signs, almost like a toll booth
		- "You'll look three years younger"
		- "Feel like a kid again"
		- "Wash away all traces of swamp rot"
	- Well groomed troll operating toll booth, says it costs 5sp each so [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) paid and he lead the three to a surprisingly nice spring
	- Relaxing in the spring gave each of the dippers inspiration

- While travelling again, we saw smoke plumes in the sky in the far distance towards Phandalin
- Travelled through the night and as we approached town during the morning there were banners bearing the symbol of Grummsh, basically Orc Jesus
- As we approach town there are blood splatters, dead people, dead horses etc.
- Most homes have doors smashed in, many are smoldering with flames
- Burning pile of corpses in town hall

- Heard orcs and hid, [Adriel](Adriel.md) called lightning and killed all orcs but one
- Interrogated an orc, he said he was from the mountain where [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md)'s family is from saying the dwarves took it from them
	- Their leader is the Great Ulfe
	- Killed him after interrogation
- Headed toward the Manor on the east side of town where we could hear a loud banging coming from
- Approached door, saw four orcs trying to barge in and [Adriel](Adriel.md) killed them
	- Boys went inside manor, girls stayed at door to keep watch
	- Boys found an old neighbour of [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md)'s, Qelline Alderleaf, a local farmer
	- She said the orcs arrived a couple days ago
	- Offered to let her travel with us until we reach the next major settlement she can stay at
- Ended session by deciding to camp out in the town green for the night in case any more orcs show up or stragglers come out before departing town
