# Session 101 Notes
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) returned the 50gp to [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md)'s fan

## Yawning Portal
- Party asked [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) about [Rowan](Rowan.md), she told them:
	- He ended things with her very suddenly
	- Left her a letter before disappearing on sabbatical
	- He left her about 2 months before she met the party
	- He left her a month after she got cursed, in that month was very focused on trying to remove the amulet from her
	- It was causing him a lot of mental pain seeing [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) being hurt and disappointed over and over again every time they tried to remove the amulet

### Scrying on Rowan
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) scried on [Rowan](Rowan.md), per [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md)'s suggestion
	- Could feel that the scrying made its way through some sort of magical ward before entering chamber
	- Obsidian hall lined with gold within Mount Hotenow
	- [Rowan](Rowan.md) in this sanctum with an array of magical artifacts and arcane ingredients scattered on floor, bedroll nearby
		- Objects on floor align with the ingredients read about in the book from Eldric
			- Elder root
			- Vial of blood
			- Nightshade
			- etc
	- Hunched over, scribbling on pages, rearranging artifacts in different configurations
		- Muttering in arcane, puts arms out, waits for something, nothing happens
	- Chamber is sealed, no visible entrances or exits
	- In front of him is massive orange and red light
		- Around the light is huge chains tethering it to the sanctum
		- Massive whirling tornado of flame encased in crystal, crystal chained to sanctum
	- He looks particularly driven
	- Starts making an attempted recreation of the Blackstaff Steak Sandwich
	- Appears as though he has been there for a few weeks tops
	- Large stone obsidian door which could be an entrance to the room
- [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) said speaking from experience
	- Was once in adventuring party not unlike ours
	- The group had descended into a ruined ziggurat in a jungle
	- City nearby had complained that a cult was causing chaos in the jungle
	- Every level in this ziggurat, the slumbering deity had been poisoning their thoughts!
	- At bottom floor it had all but turned us against each other
	- [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md), wizard managed to stay strong but Barbarian with an axe and a Rogue completely turned and wanted to awaken the deity
	- In the end [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) was the only survivor but brought the ziggurat down around the tome, made it out
	- Don't let some ancient god whisper into your mind or try to get you to do something you shouldn't

## Rita's
- Went to [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita)'s for potions
	- Just resistant to fire
	- Last 1 hour each
	- Bought 10
	- Each wrapped with bows, nice notes with potions

## Neverwinter
- Teleported to the House of Knowledge within Neverwinter
	- Big library and temple to Oghma
	- One of the most impressive buildings in Neverwinter
	- Has some of the most rare tomes outside of Candlekeep in a vault.
- Left House of Knowledge and were approached (hostilely) by robed figure riding a giant salamander, and 4 goons
	- Masked men following him with hammers with caged embers
	- The group seemed to be tracking [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md), so she approached to greet them and they said that they wanted her amulet
		- They also knew her by her GOVERNMENT NAME
		- She questioned them and asked who they were and why they wanted the amulet
		- Called themselves the Heralds of the Flame and drew their blades, so [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) cast Dominate Person on their leader
			- He also Silvery Barbsed the guy, and gave [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) advantage for when combat starts next session
