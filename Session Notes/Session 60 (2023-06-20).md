#Unexpected-Wedding 
[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Past/India.md), [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Adriel]] stole [[Rosalinda]]'s purse, [[Stalfor]] clocked it
- Unsure if [[Max]] was hit in the head before or after the fall from the balcony
- Couldn't find anything about the purse that indicated it may have been a murder weapon (no blunt objects inside that matched any of his wounds)
	- 1 gp, 2 sp, 6 cp, small pouch of dried lavender, 3 plain hairpins, large pendant/broach depicting some holy symbol with a large white diamond + blue star ([[Adriel]] recognizes the symbol)
- Searching Max's body:
	- well crafted/magic rapier
	- pouch with 11cp 
	- nice rings
	- under formal tunic wearing discreetly hidden elven chain shirt
- No stab wounds found
- Last time any of us saw [[Max]] was when he danced with [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) (Dance 3)

#### Dance 7
- [[Adriel]] & [[James]]
	- [[James]] is drunk and incapable of lying rn due to inebriation
	- Said he never left the dancefloor
	- [[James]] said [[Lysandrea]] looked a little concerned last he saw her
	- [[Adriel]] looked around the room to see who was missing
		- [[Milton]] is missing during this dance 
- [[Stalfor]] & [[Sirbastien]]
	- [[Sirbastien]] said his favourite dance is a Waltz guy
- [India](PCs/Past/India.md) and [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) searching the room
	- [India](PCs/Past/India.md) comforting/distracting [[Lysandrea]] and [[Rosalinda]]
	- Some things seemed out of place
		- Rug moved
			- Looked under rug for hidden compartments/trap doors and didn't find anything
		- Bedside table glasses & decanter - one glass and decanter is missing
			- Crystal wine decanter could probably be used as a blunt weapon
				- Maybe the one Adriel took? double check
		- Trunks and bags could do some damage if they're packed with heavy items
			- All empty, have been unpacked
		- Next to fireplace was wrought iron tools for stoking the fire
			- One has been sitting in the fire, red hot iron, if anything was on it then we wouldn't be able to notice :( 
	- Don't find any hidden entrances/trap doors
	- Door onto veranda opens inward to the building
	- There is a dent in the door that lines up with the corner of the fireplace - looks fresh, probably within the last couple weeks at the very least
	- Part of railing on the veranda bows outward like someone was pushed over it 

#### Dance 8
- creamy bolognese
- [India](PCs/Past/India.md) & [[Galianne]]
	- [[Galianne]] said it would be "an evening for the memories"
	- [[Galianne]] asked [India](PCs/Past/India.md) if she thinks [[Lysandrea]] has been off tonight
	- [[Galianne]] worried [[Lysandrea]] was getting herself into a loveless marriage, but wasn't going to do anything to stop the wedding
	- [India](PCs/Past/India.md) rolled a 25 insight, and could tell [[Galianne]] held some resentment towards [[Max]], but was truthful when saying she wouldn't meddle in the affairs of the wedding
- [[Adriel]] & [[Rita]]
	- [[Rita]] had a gap in the middle of the evening
		- She said she had a hard time finding a dance partner because it seemed like the dance floor thinned out quite a bit
	- Has a crush on [[James]] for sure
	- She said [India](PCs/Past/India.md) is in love with [[James]] (not really but made a comment that she understands what India sees in him) 
- [[Stalfor]] & [[James]]
	- [[James]] said he's heard interesting stories about brews and potions from [[Rita]]
	- [[James]]' vibe is he's here for a good time not a long time
	- Thought [[Roslinda]] was a ray of sunshine, had fun playing music for her at the picnic, but didn't see her much during the dance and wished he had
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) in master suite/outside
	- Searched through closet for any clues, didn't find anything
	- Searched drawers and shelves but didn't find anything
	- Outlines of footsteps on veranda but they all blend together
	- Railing of veranda above Max is bowed outward, but not very much. Lines up with where Max is on the ground.
	- Searched the ground, lots of crystal fragments, footprints around his body, someone was kneeling over him, couldn't find footprints going anywhere away from the lodge

#### Dance 9
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) & [[Milton]]
	- Ran into Milton on the way to the dance floor, he added a bow tie and replaced his low pony with a top knot for their dance (kaitlin ugly crying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
	- Said he grew up in a small village near Winterhold, when he came of age he left the village he found work as a footman, eventually finding work with the D'arlingtons, hired by Max's father.
	- Said he feels no need to leave the D'arlington family, he is gainfully employed, Sylvia saw no indication he was lying
- [[Stalfor]] & [[Thalgion]]
	- [[Thalgion]] said he tried to help [[Rosalinda]] search for her purse for a brief time
	- Said he overheard [[Galianne]] and [[Max]] quarrelling at some point in the night, [[Stalfor]] told him that he heard the two used to be romantically involved
		- [[Thalgion]] said he heard her slap him
		- He heard this commotion while in one of the sitting rooms, it was either in the master suite or the dining room
	- [[Stalfor]] told [[Thalgion]] about the rumours of the mining operation
		- [[Thalgion]] stopped the dance and was instantly cross
- [[Adriel]] and [India](PCs/Past/India.md) searching parlour for stuff
	- Inspecting drugged wine: mulberry in bouquet (seems out of place), laced with heavy doses of sleeping draught
		- India took a swig, could taste that it was dosed with something else they couldn't smell
		- Doesn't taste very alcoholic? Someone maybe added magic potion to it to prevent the drinker from getting completely drunk
