# Session 97 Notes
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) went to Yawning Portal the next morning, found a paper on the way to figure out the date - determined three months had passed since they left for the Feywild
- Told the party about [Rowan](Rowan.md) and his disappearance, and how he might be in danger so she'd like to follow on the lead to his whereabouts
- Decided to go to the Blackstaff Tower and [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita)'s Potions before heading to Frug's

## [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita)'s Potions
- HUGE sign, fancy coloured lanterns in the window
- People aren't allowed in the store, and she has a drive thru window
	- People trying to get diagnosed in line by [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita) (pharmacist)
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) played a tune and drew a crowd
	- Made it to the front of the line 
		- [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita) was very excited to see [India](PCs/Current/India.md)
		- Gave [India](PCs/Current/India.md) 3x Healing Potions for free

## Blackstaff Tower
- Introduced party to [Eldric](Eldric.md), asked him how to find Frug
	- He finds you
	- OR
	- Abandoned lot in the dock ward of Blackstar lane
		- Should be a small bell you can ring at the entryway, dont stand within the fenced in property
	- Sylvaranth Staff - is an artifact critical to a particular group of people
		- Has been passed down through generations for a long time
		- If the artifact can be stuck in a particular type of sentiment/feeling, this one def has been
			- Anything wizards at the tower would do would be to contain it
			- Anyone who wields it would certainly fall down the same path as the previous wielder
			- The spell Hallow might "right" the "wrong" of this staff, otherwise it's best to archive it or destroy it

## Blackstar Lane
- Rung the bell, Frug's tower appears, settles in front of us similar to Howl's Moving Castle <3
- Colourful plumes of smoke leaving the chimneys at the top of the tower
- Found Frug. Huge sadist according to [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md). So [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) beat him up and hated every second of it but Frug loved it and gave up all the info she asked for
	- [Rowan](Rowan.md) had visited, got all the ingredients he sought out and then left for Candlekeep
	- [Rowan](Rowan.md) said something about Candlekeep to Frug
		- Going to Candlekeep to find an account of Kossuth.
		- God of elemental fire and purification through fire, AKA Fire Lord
