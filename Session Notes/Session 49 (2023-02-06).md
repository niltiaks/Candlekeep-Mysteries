#Zikran-Tome 
[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Past/India.md), [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Finished long rest and began to climb the mountain again
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) almost died doing some bouldering but finally rolled a (double) Nat20 and made it up the wall with [India](PCs/Past/India.md)'s help
	- ![[Pasted image 20230510221348.png]]

- Found a tower with roof that was smashed in from above, [India](PCs/Past/India.md) and [[Adriel]] seem to think rubble scattered around may have been caused by a cyclone/tornado
- Went into main room on first floor, there were three display cases containing scrolls written in dwarvish
	- The titles of the scrolls indicate they depict the history of the cloud giants that once occupied this keep
		- The giants set up base here to be away from the squabbles of other giants
		- Giants became a force for good in the region until their patron was thrown in a coup by enemies of wind duke
		- Keep fell to ruin as last remnants of the clan were wiped by eradicators
	- Gazre seems good intentioned, just wants out of his silly book ([Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) insight checked)
- Cloud giants are all over the place, all seem non-hostile
- Sad ghost cloud giants :(
- Fight against ice mephits and water elementals! [India](PCs/Past/India.md) is under de water
- After the fight we heard a dull thrumming sound from down the stairs with crackles of lightning.
