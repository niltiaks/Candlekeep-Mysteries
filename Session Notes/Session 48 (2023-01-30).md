#Zikran-Tome 
[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Current/India.md), [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md), [[Adriel]]

- Woke up after long rest, [India](PCs/Current/India.md) noticed a long creature burrowing into the ground over the night from a distance.
	- The creature [India](PCs/Current/India.md) saw was likely at least 25 feet long
- Heard the sound of crushing ice but it sounded far enough away that we didn't need to worry about it yet, so we carried on up the mountain
- Later, [India](PCs/Current/India.md) heard something shuffling in the ridges as we were walking between them. [[Adriel]] saw a draconic wing on one of the ridges and misty stepped up to it.
	- Turned out to be a group of flying kobolds, fought them off and continued up the mountain
- The Hills Have Eyes - [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) noticed some icy rock with seemingly beady eyes, very far off in the distance. Maybe being watched?
- Stopped for the night, [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) took first watch and heard thingies burrowing in rocks, she woke the party as they burst out of the cliffside (frost salamaders)
