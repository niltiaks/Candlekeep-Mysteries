- Asking [[Milton]] about mulberry and silver lotus

		- Heard about silver lotus which lessens the effect of alcohol, want to know if he might have any in storage so she can keep up
			- [[Max]] has tendency to over indulge, to help his night run smoothly [[Milton]] adds a little "something" so he doesn't get completely foxed lol

		- In library, talked to Dizzy the pseudodragon or whatever she is
