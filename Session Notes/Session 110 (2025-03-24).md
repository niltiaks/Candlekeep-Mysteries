# Session 110 Notes
## Blackstaff Tower
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) got up early to go to Blackstaff Tower
- Southern Gate and River Gate blocked off
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) went to the Tower to speak with [Eldric](NPCs/Living/Eldric.md)
	- Visited [Eldric](NPCs/Living/Eldric.md) in his office, promised to check in every 24 hours over the next few days
	- Filled him in (briefly) on the [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) story and the amulet, promised to give more info when the battle is all over
- [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) was working in his office nearby, definitely had been crying
	- After [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) initially walked by he shut the door
	- When she walked by after speaking to [Eldric](NPCs/Living/Eldric.md), she left [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) a note under his door that said:
	> *Be safe
			- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md)*

## Castle Waterdeep
- Got to the Council Hall, spoke with [Laeral](Laeral.md), she said Force Gray has not returned yet - not expected for a few hours at least
	- Fortunately, no new developments from the enemy's side
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) and [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) decided to wait at the castle until the meeting started 
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) played music on a chaise until he passed out
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) got a late breakfast and prepared her spells for the day


- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) arrived and joined the group
	- Discovered everyone had strange dreams last night
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) cast a sending for [India](PCs/Current/India.md) to Rita, to tell her to not trust foul dreams and to be safe. Rita wanted to meet [India](PCs/Current/India.md) at the Yawning Portal to discuss in more detail so [India](PCs/Current/India.md) left the castle.
		- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) filled Rita in on the threat, asked her to stay safe
		- Rita offered to join the party in the strike force, [India](PCs/Current/India.md) declined
		- Then [India](PCs/Current/India.md) went back to the Castle

- On [India](PCs/Current/India.md)'s way back, she noticed a group of injured adventurers (likely Force Gray lol)
	- Passed by them to get to the Castle

- Shortly after [India](PCs/Current/India.md) returned, Force Gray returned and informed [Laeral](Laeral.md) of the update.
- [Laeral](Laeral.md) shared the news:
	- Blackrazor's army is a war machine seemingly driven beyond a will of their own
	- Driven by the purpose to consume cities whole
	- Army is all branded with a mark that allows the Blackrazor to claim their souls upon death
	- Legion of warforged machines, march without hesitation, exhaustion, or fear
	- There are a group of Candlekeep scholars who have joined him to repurpose the knowledge of skitterwidgets for war
	- Grippli war bands - large, heavily mutated grippli standing taller than an orc
	- Saw horrors they could not describe - aberrations from beyond our plane
		- Some crawled from within purple storm above flying citadel
	- Bringing up rear was legions of undead - from people the Blackrazor has consumed
	- Storm is not a cover - appears to be a weapon of chemical warfare or something similar
	- Massive citadel has weapons and stuff, dragons with some connection to the storm
		- Undead dragons scouting also bear the same purple smoke that lies in the wake of the flying citadel
		- Base of citadel protected by arcane canons, manned by robed scholars - probably from Candlekeep
	- Core of magic likely lies at heart of fortress to power its magic and the storm around us
	- Plan:
		- Use griffons to get to citadel
		- Globe of invulnerability scroll and add to spell book
		- Summon Adriel's dire wolves in courtyard to help clear path
		- Bee line for the citadel entrance
		- Once inside, work quickly <3
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) went back to the tower to access the arcane archives to add Globe of Invulnerability to her spellbook and then create a scroll
