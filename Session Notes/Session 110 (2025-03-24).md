# Session 110 Notes
## Blackstaff Tower
- Avalon got up early to go to Blackstaff Tower
- Southern Gate and River Gate blocked off
- Avalon went to the Tower to speak with Eldric
	- Visited Eldric in his office, promised to check in every 24 hours over the next few days
	- Filled him in (briefly) on the Rowan story and the amulet, promised to give more info when the battle is all over
- Rowan was working in his office nearby, definitely had been crying
	- After Avalon initially walked by he shut the door
	- When she walked by after speaking to Eldric, she left Rowan a note that said:
> 	*Be safe
			- Avalon*

## Castle Waterdeep
- Got to the Council Hall, spoke with Laeral, she said Force Gray has not returned yet - not expected for a few hours at least
	- Fortunately, no new developments from the enemy's side
- Harland and Avalon decided to wait at the castle until the meeting started 
	- Harland played music on a chaise until he passed out
	- Avalon got a late breakfast and prepared her spells for the day


- India and Stalfor arrived and joined the group
	- Discovered everyone had strange dreams last night
	- Avalon cast a sending for India to Rita, to tell her to not trust foul dreams and to be safe. Rita wanted to meet India at the Yawning Portal to discuss in more detail so India left the castle.
		- India filled Rita in on the threat, asked her to stay safe
		- Rita offered to join the party in the strike force, India declined
		- Then India went back to the Castle

- On India's way back, she noticed a group of injured adventurers (likely Force Gray lol)
	- Passed by them to get to the Castle

- Shortly after India returned, Force Gray returned and informed Laeral of the update.
- Laeral shared the news:
	- Blackrazor's army is a war machine seemingly driven beyond a will of their own
	- Driven by the purpose to consume cities whole
	- Army is all branded with a mark that allows the Blackrazor to claim their souls upon death
	- Legion of warforged machines, march without hesitation, exhaustion, or fear
	- There are a group of Candlekeep scholars who have joined him to repurpose the knowledge of skitterwidgets for war
	- Grippli war bands - large, heavily mutated grippli standing taller than an orc
	- Saw horrors they could not describe - aberrations from beyond our plane
		- Some crawled from within purple storm above flying citadel
	- Bringing up rear was legions of undead - from people the Blackrazor has consumed
	- Storm is not a cover - appears to be a weapon of chemical warfare or something similar
	- Massive citadel has weapons and stuff, dragons with some connection to the storm
		- Undead dragons scouting also bear the same purple smoke that lies in the wake of the flying citadel
		- Base of citadel protected by arcane canons, manned by robed scholars - probably from Candlekeep
	- Core of magic likely lies at heart of fortress to power its magic and the storm around us
	- Plan:
		- Use griffons to get to citadel
		- Globe of invulnerability scroll and add to spell book
		- Summon Adriel's dire wolves in courtyard
		- Globe and bee line for the citadel entrance
		- Once inside, work quickly <3
	- Avalon went back to the tower to access the arcane archives to add Globe of Invulnerability to her spellbook and then create a scroll
