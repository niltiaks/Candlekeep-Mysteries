# Session 91 Notes
### At Onvyr's Library:
- He told us that he's been at the library searching for a solution
- Sent his staff home to be with their families
- Has been doing his own research, doesn't believe there is one single potion/cure, and that the cure is tied to the root
	- There is something about the plague that links its victims together
	- Candlekeep associate of [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) thinks she might have a solution, [Zelyth](Zelyth.md) Lightleaf
- [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) teleported us to Candlekeep and accompanied us inside

		- Wanted to scare off industrialization and preserve "natural order of things"
