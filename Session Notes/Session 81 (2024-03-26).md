#FeywildArc 
[[Avalon]], [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Ronorin]] called [[Adriel]] his sprout ðŸ˜­
- [[Ronorin]] said there was a blight in the Summer Court
	- Searching for some sort of artifact or item of legend
	- [[Ronorin]] was the one who set the corruption that grips the Feywild to bring about some sort of new age?
	- The ruling courts of the Feywild have long turned a blind eye to the suffering of less fortunate
	- I sought to unmake the courts to pave the way to a new age
	- A future where all beings can thrive regardless of status or lineage
	- A transformation that will echo through the ages
	- Asked [[Adriel]] if he would stand by him and help him
- [[Adriel]] insight checked the monologue (32) and nothing seemed to be clouding his mind. He seemed hopeful but tinged with a hint of desperation.
- [[Adriel]] initially declined but said he wanted to speak with his wife, [[Ronorin]] said to take all the time he needs 
- [[Ronorin]] has set up a small town for those loyal to him amongst the Dream Grove, but we won't find him there
- He is searching for this artifact in case he can't rely on [[Adriel]]

- Set off to find his wife, same way we found [[Ronorin]] (by thinking of them and thinking happy thoughts to try to shape the path)
	- Path seemed jagged and dark
	- Dim light illuminating the forest clouded over and began to get a summer rain
	- [[Adriel]] held onto a gift for his wife to try to help shape the path even more, rain died down and trees parted a bit
	- Walked for another hour or so and came upon a clearing ([[Adriel]]'s home)

- Village before [[Adriel]] left:
	- Basic little village, maybe 25ish people
	- Lots of colourful flowers
	- Small small houses (1-2 rooms)
	- Smaller paths (can walk 2 abreast)
- Village now:
	- Most flowers dead
	- Paths are washed out and mucky
	- Surrounding fields have deteriorated
	- Houses still in place but a few here and there have caved in roofs 

- Went to [[Adriel]]'s house, roof was NOT caved in
- Knocked on door, his wife answered
	- Her face was pale and gaunt, much more than before
	- Her name is [[Gormal]], greeted [[Adriel]] and welcomed everyone in
	- She said years ago the sun started to fade, a chill set in the air
	- A grey in the world followed suit shortly after
	- Both of his children fell into some sort of coma, one of them didn't survive and is buried in the yard
	- His daughter survived but was still asleep, [[Adriel]] immediately went to check on her
	- He cast a level 6 dispel magic that woke her up
		- Said she was dreaming that she was getting chased in a field by an angry tree whose roots got a hold of her and pulled her across the ground and into the dirt and she did not like that.
		- [[Adriel]] said she was safe now, gave her medicine book to read "so she could become an adventurer too"
- [[Gormal]] showed [[Adriel]] their son's grave, shared a sad moment
- [[Adriel]] gave [[Gormal]] the broach he bought for her and they KISSED ðŸ’‹
- [[Gormal]] asked if she could offer anything to the party and they said a roof over their heads was plenty and if she needed anything they'd be happy to help
- Got long rest in the house, through the night it seemed dark and spooky

- [[Gormal]] made us a small breakfast in the morning, bread was meh and berries were shriveled but that's because of the blight
- Set off for the day, [[Adriel]] told [[Gormal]] he would do anything to get back to her and their daughter

- Followed [[Adriel]] into the woods, he intimidated the forest to show us a path to [[Titania]]
- Path appeared, after a while of travelling started to see lightning flashes in the sky, big galloping but bigger than horse.
- Sounds of trees crashing into the ground
- Path lead us to small pond, off to the right heard the pounding of feet reaching a crescendo
- Out of corner of eye we saw three heads rear up over treeline: draconic looking creature with many legs, long tail, and as it roars out it shoots crackles of lightning into the sky
	- [[Avalon]] did History check (28) thinks maybe its some sort of corrupted behir
	- Draconic creatures of lightning
	- Fought the three behirs, carried on behind [[Adriel]]

- Light became thinner and thinner the closer we reached the Court of Summer and the trees became more dense
- With [[Adriel]]'s skillful pathfinding, we found ourselves coming upon a clearing in the grove
- As we stepped out from trees, we felt a warm sensation around us with lights in the trees
	- Steps spiraling up around trees to platforms with lanterns in windows and nooks
	- Some sort of elaborate or grand festival appeared to be occurring at base of trees
