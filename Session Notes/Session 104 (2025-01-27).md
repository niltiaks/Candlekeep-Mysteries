# Session 103 Notes
### Cultist Room
- Inquisitors:
	- Inquisitor 1 - Zorven - Fire genasi, the one Inquisitor Harland was speaking to the most. Right hand is burned and scarred
	- Inquisitor 2 - Human woman, flushed with unnatural redness, silver hair streaked with red, left eye is milky white
	- Inquisitor 3 - Dwarf man, skin colour of smoldering coal, dark beard striped with fiery orange
1. Harland used dispel magic on the door and it seemed to release the ward but there was still something sealing it shut
	- The inquisitors split up into the other side sanctums to try to open the center one
2. Harland eavesdropping on the cultist groups:
	- One group discussing how its good one group went to Baldur's Gate to find Avalon because they apparently found her in Neverwinter, are relieved
	- One group discussing Kossuth's return must be planned, organized, ready before attempting to undergo ritual, but the cultists seem to think Zorven is the de facto leader.
		- They discuss how Zorven has this belief where he doesn't think they should wait and they should try anything necessary to resurrect Kossuth
		- Will they take this opportunity of Arkenth showing himself to the cult to shift the power balance
11. Inquisitors came back from left chamber, and said they were successful in opening their side, but Zorven couldn't fix his side
	- Harland suggested they go help Zorven
	- Also told them his "theory" that Arkenth and Avalon have some sort of relation to each other, and they should keep him alive if they break into the sanctum because they could use it as leverage to lure her (with her amulet) into the sanctum.
12. Harland got a short rest, while observing the murals/tapestries about the Chains of Kossuth:
	>	The First Mural: _This depicts Kossuth in all his fiery glory, towering above smaller figures of wizards and clerics. His form is a roiling inferno, with tendrils of flame extending outward like the rays of a burning sun. The mortals are shown crafting intricate spells, their hands weaving arcane sigils in the air. Below them, a great volcano erupts, symbolizing the raw power of the Firelord._
	>	The Second Mural: _The central panel shows a moment of triumph and calamity. Kossuthâ€™s titanic form is surrounded by arcane chains of magic and radiance, forged from the combined might of the arcane and divinity. The wizards and clerics, shown in painstaking detail, stand in a circle, channeling their power into binding him. The volcano in the background is now calm, its peak capped with clouds of ash and smoke._
	>	The Third Mural: _The final panel illustrates the creation of the sanctum itself. It depicts the wizards and clerics constructing the obsidian prison deep within the volcano, their hands shaping the massive blocks of stone. At the center of the mural is an ominous doorway, radiating heat and marked by a large sigil of Kossuth. The figures themselves appear to be in quiet reverence for the fallen deity._

### Kitchen
1. India and Stalfor entered  the kitchens
	- Young human male, cooking up some grub in typical cultist garb
	- India lied and said she was new and was looking for a job to do here, recommended by Rowan
		- He did NOT like that and started calling for reinforcements, shouting about intruders, so India ran in to ~_silence_~ him
		- She knocked him out cold and stuffed him in the ice box room
	- India put on his cultist robes
2. Chef India tried to play it cool after the cultist entered the room and offered to help
10. India went back in and knocked out the cultist
	- She grabbed a big bowl and put darkest ingredients into the bowl (oils, spices, etc), slathered on the meat
	- Brought out stack of dishes and food to table, said sorry she made a mess and needed to clean up
	- She put him into the ice box
11. India was trying to concoct a sleep potion to knock out all of the cultists.
12. Cultists caught on to the ruse, Avalon warped India out and the cultists caught her, a fight ensued and party easily knocked out all of the cultists. India stole the mean one's shoes.

### Hallway 
1. Cultist started entering the dining room, Avalon misty stepped into hallway to retreat, entered the kitchen
2. Avalon stayed in the hallway with the door open a crack to listen in
3. Avalon cast sending to Harland, to see if he wanted to explore with us, he said he was good in the cultist room
11. Avalon was watching the cultists via her hidden spellbook, and six of them entered the kitchen, straight from the sanctum, looking for food to scavenge from the kitchen
	- India meanwhile was bringing out more food for them, told them the meat had a "big problem" from a "terrible accident" so it was cheese and wine snow

### Study/Office
3. Avalon, India, Stalfor went inside and searched
	- Book about fire attuned artifacts
		- Avalon ripped the following pages out and pocketed them:
		- One of inquisitors attempts at cataloguing potential items that might hold promise as a catalyst to evoke Kossuth
		- One passage stands out:
			- Entry 1: 
			> _We located the tomb of a powerful elven fire wizard, but a group of adventurers had beat us to the score. We dealt with most of the adventurers with ease but there was a half-blooded elf spellcaster with them, with piercing blue eyes and an amulet with a large red gem that appeared burned to her chest. I'll never forget the arcane havoc she wrought on our expedition group that day. Could she have been a descendant there to reclaim a family heirloom? Whatever the reason, we must find out more about her and secure that amulet, it could be the key to our salvation._
			
			- Next entry:
			>_Our half elven witch is proving difficult to track. We detect signs of her on the material plane one day, and in the outer planes the next. We must take great care ensure an inquisitor is present when we are able to confront her._

			- Next Entry:
			>_Our research has borne fruit - we have uncovered that the woman we seek is called Avalon Shepherd, a wizard of the Blackstaff Academy. The protective wards there explain why our scrying has been ineffective. We should send detachments of the Hand of Flame to other major cities in hopes we can catch her away on business - it would be too risky to confront her in Waterdeep close to her colleagues._

### Metalwork Room
5. Cultist India went in first, cultist in here making studded leather armour
7. Cultist Avalon went in here, almost got caught but made it through to the eastern hall

### Study #2
6. Cultist India went in here, found a map carved into a slate, took it

### Library
8. Ancient tomes and scrolls in disarray
	- There are some wards in place around the room, cooling the ambient temperature
	- Flip through books and scrolls, no information in here seems new

### Mystery Door/Barracks
9. Could hear voices on other side of door, as this was happening Avalon noticed cultists entering the dining room for dinner and one went into the kitchen, so she went back to India and Stalfor to warn them.
