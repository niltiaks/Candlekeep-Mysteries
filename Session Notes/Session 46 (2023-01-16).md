- Departed from Yawning Portal, decided to walk to find the spire.

### Day 1
- Travel was peaceful

### Day 2:
- Came across a stone bridge. On the bridge was a hobgoblin dressed in platemail with a tabard of red sun
- Hobgoblin standing on platform build up on bridge and a frame built up around a dummy holding a spear at him
- Hobgoblin looks like he's aging like fine wine
- Says he is from the Order of the Red Dawn
- It was actually a trap and there were a bunch of hobgoblins hiding around
- Day 2 night - Saw the flapping of massive wings but nothing came of it

### Day 3:
- We found our way to the large coral spire
- Camped out overnight but in the morning the tide was in, taking our time as the tide goes out so we can get to the spire
- Found the cave, saw two bodies and with a good Medicine check determined they died by drowning
- Glowing stones hanging from chamber
- Chamber has circular stone dais with grooves to hold some type of device
- Atop dais is a young bronze dragon wearing a coral crown, dragon's name is Ashgarleth
	- He said Zikran was the previous tenant, doesn't know where he went
	- Gave us an old diary of Zikran's
		 - Comments about a rival named Laffa who sought out Zikran's lab, so he left in a hurry. Diary was left behind but he does describe his route to the "cloud giants"
	- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) acquired a piece of a map
		 - Map is a section of sword coast showing dashed line to a spot labelled "Cloud Peaks" with the note "Here?" next to it.
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) got some diagrams of some sort of cannon whose energy source is elemental air?
- Left the cave and are now heading to the "Cloud Peaks"
