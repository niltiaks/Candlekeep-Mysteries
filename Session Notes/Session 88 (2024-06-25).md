	- Giant heart, blackened and rotten

- Ronorin monologue!!!
> My sprout, Titania is weak. Trust in me now and together we can remake the Feywild. Remember the times i guided you through the darkest woods join me now and we will remake the Feywild as it should be.

- Titania monologue!!!
> My cleric, do not let Ronorin's bitterness taint your soul. The Feywild needs your strength and purity now more than ever.

- Adriel monologue
> I remember the times we've had, all the times spent looking at stars by a fire. I remember when you first found me as a child and brought me to the Feywild. I thought it was the best thing that had ever happened to me. Seeing what you have done now and done to me family... I see now that needing you was the worst thing that could have happened to me, and I'm putting it in the past, and I will not be joining you.

- To this, Ronorin cast a crazy spell that Avalon counterspelled
