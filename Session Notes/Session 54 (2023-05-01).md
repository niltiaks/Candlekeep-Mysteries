# Notes
## Sylvan Retreat:
- "Mouse" is a half-orc who works at the Sylvan Retreat, only other patron at the tavern
- At night, a streak of light in sky that flares very brightly, fades away after a few moments (meteor???)
- Maud gave each of us a pack of berries and cheeses

- Left the inn and set out back on the road
