#FeywildArc
[Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md), [India](PCs/Current/India.md), [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md), [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)

- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) returned to the tavern saying he needed to go home
	- Something is wrong in the Feywild and he was also having nightmares
	- Showed us the pixie
	- Plane shifted us to the Feywild
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) started glowing a faint blue
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md)'s face turned puffin-ish
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md)'s shadow got a personality of its own, which kept searching for something with an hourglass

- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) gave us rules of the Feywild:
	1. Emotion shapes all
	2. Time is an illusion
	3. Only mortals deal in absolutes - everything is negotiable
	4. Things usually happen in threes
	5. Most fey are unable to lie
	6. Bargains are magically binding
	7. If a faerie gives you something they'll expect something in return 
		- Except Autumn court - the giving court
	8. Names give power over others
	9. Certain fey have weaknesses
		- Cold Iron - representing cold, hard reality
		- Running water - tends to change the flow of magic
		- Their own logic - using their own bizarre logic against them

- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) said he lied about his name and where he's from and his backstory??

- Party began walking, found a clearing with a large black bear
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) could speak to it, it was complaining about being really itchy and asking for water
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) inspected the bear and its skin seemed really loose?
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) gave it some water and the bear blossomed into a demogorgon looking ass thing, party killed it and carried on deeper into the fey woods

- As we were walking deeper, we came across a tiny fort with folks hurling some sort of projectiles at [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)
	- Upon closer inspection, there were about half a dozen mice wearing armour and wielding weapons
		- Leader mouse said "Who do you owe your allegiance to?" Adriel said queen of summer court
		- Mouse captain told his platoon to stand down. Said it was war times
	- Mouse captain told us:
		- Strange creatures attacking the mouse fort
		- Said something is wrong at the heart of the Feywild
		- Has been going on for weeks
		- Mouse army sent an envoy to the Summer Court a fortnight ago but haven't heard anything since
		- The mice protect the part of the forest between the Phoenix Rest and Tavern Meadow
		- Mouse asked us to deliver word that [[Sir Matthias]] is standing strong 

- Carried on, heading straight for the Summer Court off the path
	- Tried to go around flower and move forward
	- Nearby tree seemed to display faces/humanoid visages calling out, slammed down at the party but missed
	- Found another tree that seemed to have a similar face
	- Trees seem to be following us?
	- Headed back to the path which was blocked by the large flower

- Tried to pass the flower without disturbing it, but it stank so bad it incapacitated [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) then lashed at her

- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) told the party to think happy thoughts to try to shape the environment around them
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) thought of his fey friends he might see soon
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) thought of her family in Goldenfields
	- The others were too distracted by the eeriness of the woods, which lashed out at [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md)

- Finally caught glimpse of the Summer Court in the distance, but it looked darker than usual everything else (which was already eerie and unusual)
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) cast scrying on [Ronorin](NPCs/Living/Ronorin.md), his adoptive father/mentor
		- Seemed like he could sense the scry but couldn't pinpoint the exact location
		- [Ronorin](NPCs/Living/Ronorin.md) was walking with two Eladrin, who seemed muted in colour
			- The Eladrin would be Summer Eladrin but they don't look much like it anymore
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) was unable to determine where exactly Ronorin was, but it did seem like his group was walking with purpose
		- The Eladrin seemed like they were his entourage?

- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) focused his thoughts on happy memories with Ronorin and a path appeared in the woods
- After a few hours, the path lead us to [Ronorin](NPCs/Living/Ronorin.md) who greeted us (mainly [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)) and that's where we ended the session
