- Ended previous session with [[Rita]]'s arrival to the Silver Lodge, about half an hour to go until the dance begins
- [[Rita]] told [India](PCs/Current/India.md) that she's been adventuring recently
- While folks were getting ready [[Rita]] knocked on [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)'s door
	- Part of the reason Rita went to the wedding was because in her journeys around the Sword Coast, she heard some troubling rumours about the Silver Lodge
	- She heard that there was mithril underneath the falls and said she felt a bad feeling about the wedding
	- Thinks it's suspicious that a family known for its mining endeavors are marrying the family that own the lodge and the surrounding land where the mithril is unmined
	- They told [[Rita]] about Ruby Eye and what they know
