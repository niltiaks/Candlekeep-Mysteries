- Transported into Vyridian Forest, inside the book
- Met elven woman named [[Ki'lara]], told her we were headed to Wisteria Vale
- Heading to Blossom's Rest in center of town, tell [[Daphne]] [[Ki'lara]] said hi
- Reached Wisteria Vale, took the farm path.
	- Lots of produce and livestock, lots of plants and crops
	- Observed the townsfolk, noticed cabbage hauler go into farm, come out with empty cart, started loading up with other produce
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) noticed a farmhand near to us, and whenever time he gripped a fork he heard a faint clicking sound - maybe automatons?
	- Found the tavern, run by a hill dwarf, asked for [[Daphne]] and said hi
	- [[Daphne]] mentioned a festival at the manor later tonight, hosted at the manor by one "Lord [[Quill]]"
		- Apparently Lord [[Quill]] tends to come down into town in the evenings but hasn't come down in a while
		- Maybe because of the strange, many-eyed creature that arrived about a week ago
			- Floating, has lots of eyes
- Broke into manor after there was no knock on the door.
	- Servant in kitchen was a mannequin, stole his key ring and stole place setting from adjacent dining room
	- Went to sitting room on lower level and saw a painting of a young [[Quill]] with [[Ryllia]], Ryllia's face scratched out. Another gigantic painting spanning the wall of forest that [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) almost fell into.
	- Left the room and explored some sort of backstage area, leading to grand hall with giant statue rearranging tables.
	- Turned around and saw two walking suits of armor going into the kitchen/dining room, we B-Lined it up the stairs and into a bedroom
	- Entered the bedroom painting and fought a roc, the room we were put in had 3 doors that went to other paintings
	- Adriel went into a door that led to chaise lounge room with Quill, doors disappeared?
