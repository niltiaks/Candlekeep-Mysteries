	- Searching parlour for [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) still (or other clues)
		- Searched balcony, didn't find much

			- Easy to presume that this is Max's room
			- Found stuff packed for the couple's honeymoon
		- Found boot room
- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) & [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md)
	- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) approached from the lodge, gave a DEEP bow, called him SIR ADRIEL
		- Asked how he felt about [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md)
			- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) insight checked, seemed like he was LYING (he was a little quick to dismiss it)
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) said he might know a girl for him
- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) & [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md)
	- Seems relaxed?
		- Talked about how "exciting" the picnic was
		- [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) blushed slightly at the mention of [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md)
		- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) told [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) that [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) is from the Feywild, and he found us using the stars to guide him?
#### Dance 5
- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) & [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md)
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) knows anything about the mining prospects in the area
		- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) was like what are u talking about? 
		- Seemed genuinely caught off guard by [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)'s question
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) shared some more details about the rumours but didn't give any details about names of people involved
		- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) seemed against mining in the area
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if he would be surprised if it was his brother leading the operation
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) offered to provide evidence to prove his claims
		- They left the dance floor, [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) showed [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) the evidence (notes and ledgers between Ruby Eye & [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md))
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if he knew if this wedding is just for land?
			- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) said if it was, it was never something he was aware of
			- Said he was never happy about [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) and [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) getting together
			- Said he wouldn't think [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) capable of this
		- Visibly upset after learning about this :(
	- When they were in private, [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if he really did have feelings for [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md)
		- He said "It doesn't matter how I feel, what matters is [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) is happy"
- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) & [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md)
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) asked if this wedding is really what she wanted - what's best and what she wants aren't always the same thing
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) told [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) about the mining prospects in the area, and that [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) and his associated have made plans for mining operations in the area in the near future
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) offered [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)'s evidence if she wanted to see it later
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) & [James](NPCs/Living/James.md)
	- Was dancing with [Rita](NPCs/Living/Rita.md), kissed her hand and started making his way over to [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) to start Dance 5
	- Not his fave style of dance, but [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md)'s dancing was so good he still had a good time :) #slayed
	- Asked if he had any fun stories about India
		- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) had a reputation for being the one with the drinks but with a risk
		- Some drinks were experimental
		- You'd find out after the drink was made
		- Found a magical orb in some ruin, that could infuse any liquid with bubbles
		- Had a touch of magic after using the bubbles orb
		- Made a brew for everyone in the dorm, everyone who drank started to float
- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) & [Lillian](NPCs/Living/Lillian.md)
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) popped Silvertongue potion before the dance
	- Tried to flirt about the dancing and it was mid
	- [Lillian](NPCs/Living/Lillian.md) is enjoying the party but feels a little blas√© about the wedding
		- Despite being high-born she doesn't always love being around nobles
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) brought up the mining op to [Lillian](NPCs/Living/Lillian.md)
		- [Lillian](NPCs/Living/Lillian.md) was like TF are u talking about. He better not. Threatened to put [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) in a headlock
	- Also told her about the note on [India](PCs/Current/India.md)'s invitation asking for her help
		- Adam definitely forgot that Phoenix told us that Lysandrea asked for help because she was worried about the curse - Stalfor made it seem like the help note was bc Lysandrea didn't want to get married smh
#### Dance 6
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) & [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md)
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) approached to fill [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) in on the situation (sent [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) away)
	- [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) approached us to ask if we had seen [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) anywhere
		- Suggested it might be the result of the D'arlington curse
		- [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) asked us to keep it private for now, concerned that if it was a murder that the murderer might flee if the death is announced
		- Based on good insight check she seemed genuinely shocked and disturbed
	- Asked us to investigate to see if it truly was an accident or foul play, hopefully before dinner (1 hour away)
- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) & [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)
	- Still no sign of [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)
	- Last [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) heard, [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) was going to check her room for her purse so he went there to check
	- Found her in her room, she was visibly frazzled, room was turned upside down
	- Said she still couldn't find her purse anywhere, [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) took a look in her room but couldn't find it either
	- Decided to check the master suite to see if her purse was there, [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) said she was in there to help Lysandrea get ready for the dance
		- No one was in the room when they arrived, couldn't find a purse anywhere
		- [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) pointed out something on the table, there was a ring left where a glass was removed
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) suddenly could smell mulberries - weird scent in the wine?
			- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) determined the wine in the room has been heavily dosed with a sleeping agent
		- Also noticed that the door to the veranda was slightly ajar
			- Went outside and noticed something in the shadows over the veranda
			- 15 feet down to the ground from veranda and saw the CRUMPLED and LIFELESS body of [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) on the ground
				- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) found several cuts and large bruise around his temples
				- Neck is broken :(
			- [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)'s purse was nearby the body
			- Noticed broken wine glass fragments around the body
- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) (No partner)
	- Went with Stalfor to search for [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
		- The papers [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) found match Lysandrea's handwriting, confirmed by matching writing to [India](PCs/Current/India.md)'s invite
- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) & [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
	- No sign of [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
