# Notes

- [Adriel](Adriel.md) just revealed to [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) that [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) was potentially murdered
	- [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md)'s reaction was to jump to his feet
	- We asked for his whereabouts during the time of the murder and he said he was busy coming and going from the kitchen, tending to the guests
	- [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) said he worried something bad had happened to [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) when he couldn't find him, he said he felt like he failed [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
	- Told [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) we thought it was him because:
		- [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) treats him poorly
		- Murderer needed to be someone strong enough to overpower [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
		- No alibi
		- [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)'s purse planted on the body, which he may have had time to find and then use to frame [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)
		- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) pointed out [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md)'s tools
			- He said they were mere keepsakes, they were part of his past that he can't seem to leave behind
			- He said he lived on the street as a child, abandoned and neglected by his parents, said he worked as a Charlatan in Northwind Gate, crossed some of the wrong people and was forced to flee, from there he stole a footman's outfit and sought out a servant's job in a smaller town
			- Turns out he was good at his job (serving) and he didn't hate it
			- Insight checks (19 and 20) seemed shaky based on what we know but he seems genuine in the way he speaks
			- Said [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)'s mistreatment bothers him but is tolerable because they provide him with a lovely lifestyle
		- [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) said [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) is suspicious
			- Because her dialect matches the orphanage where he grew up. 
			- He saw her casting a warlock ritual once, its possible she did it as an act of service for her patron?
				- Ritual before was she was off on a strange path, someone speaking foreign language through her, sitting in a ring of mushrooms with a strange light around her
	- Brought in [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) for questioning
		- Asked her if [Adriel](Adriel.md) could borrow her idol to try to communicate with [Titania](NPCs/Living/Titania.md)
			- [Adriel](Adriel.md) had a vision of a tree in a grove with a shelf/pocket in the center, asked if [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md) was sent to murder [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) because of the mining operation
				- A letter was in the pocket, as he read it he heard her voice saying "No, I did not send Rosalinda to murder"
			- [Adriel](Adriel.md) asked if she had any guidance since the religious symbol was so close to [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)'s body
				- Tree shimmered and shook, a lightning bolt shot down and cracked the tree, ground opened up and swallowed him
		- She said it was near the beginning of the dance when she noticed it missing, she had left it on a chair or table and during her dance with India it was snatched
	- Brought in [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md)
		- Lied about his whereabouts during dance 1, said he was with [Charlotte](NPCs/Living/Charlotte.md) but she said she was on the side enjoying [Evelyn](NPCs/Living/Evelyn.md)'s company
		- [Adriel](Adriel.md) commanded him and he revealed he was stealing Rosalinda's purse during that dance
		- Things escalated and [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) demanded a duel for his honour
- [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) fought [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and won
- Accused [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) of the murder and restrained him
	- Party was given 1000 gp (we split it evenly, 250gp each)
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) was given her fancy bracers <3
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) apologized to [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) and he was very receptive and understanding given the circumstances, said he respects Sylvia and understood why she did what she did
- [Adriel](Adriel.md) tried to resurrect [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) the next day, 1000gp sponsored by his family, but it failed
