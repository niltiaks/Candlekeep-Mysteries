- Jarlaxl said he could provide the mercenaries requested, suggested that [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) could lead mercenaries, so [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) and India went to speak to Durnan

- Spoke with [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md), he agreed to a pint and to lead the mercenaries the party hires. Just needed them to [Durnan](NPCs/Living/Durnan.md) to the YP

- Went back to Jarlaxl to make the deal, he had a contract for them to sign
	- All money to be paid down once contract is signed

	- Commander Kalen - Regal, fierce, woman with short gold hair and piercing amber eyes, talking to Laeral
		- Has crest of a griffon on her leather armour
		- She is reporting to Laeral that legions 3, 4, 5 of griffin cavalry are rallied. Legions 1, 2 are in the skies now, already patrolling.
	- Meloon Wardragon - Towering, broad shouldered dragonborn man, reporting to Laeral
		- This is the leader of Force Grey - adventurer's strike force
			- Elite, highly trained, individudally powerful group of adventurers
		- Conducting reconaissance missions in the South

- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) began to make her way to those speaking with Laeral, when Salvatore interrupted to approach Stalfor and India
	- Salvatore is a YAPPER
	- He said he would be able to supply them with firearms, they should visit his estate to collect what they need

- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) listened in on the Commander's conversation (above)

## Southern Ward
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) bought a child sized flute and continued on his path to Gwyn's
- Made it to Gwyn's!!!
	- She seemed surprised he actually showed up lol
	- Gwyn introduced Lorien to [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md), Harland got emotional </3
	- Gwyn is fleeing the city, heading to Neverwinter with Lorien. She asked [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) to go with them but he said he needed to help his friends protect the city, but would find them again after.
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) gave Gwyn 50pp to pay for their travel and if she needed to buy a new place to live
- Headed back to the Council Hall, on the way he sent a Sending to [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) to tell them he was in.

## Castle Waterdeep Council Hall
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) returned, approached Laeral and [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) at main war table with [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md)
	- City guard is probably about 1500 people (not including City Watch)
	- North of 10,000 for defending city
	- Outside of Southern city gate is contingent of [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md)'s mages, River gate as well has group
		- Couple thousand soldiers reinforcing the mages
	- [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) was whispering to Laeral - [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) is proposing that if things are dire, to awaken the walking statues of Waterdeep
		- Laeral responded that they will know how many to awaken upon the result of Force Grey's return to the city in a day's time
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) asked what their plans for the strike teams were
		- Force Grey is paid by Waterdeep - they are making up the strike teams along with Harland and the rest of the party
			- Most adventurers seem like they want to stay and help with Durnan's force
				- Using Yawning Portal as base of operations
				- Direct hand at protecting civilians
			- Most others have allied with city guard - a few orders of Paladins who have good relationship with General Ironsoul, will find a good place on the front lines
			- Some allied with [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md)'s mages
			- Some given position amongst Force Grey and will be joining contingent of adventurers heading South to hopefully provide with valuable information
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) suggested multiple strike forces attacking from multiple angles
		- Splinter Force Grey into many strike teams
		- Heavily relying on griffon cavalry to lead the assault on the citadel itself
		- Dragon in harbour not responsive :(
			- His name is Zelifarn - a bronze dragon
			- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) offered to go with him to speak with the dragon
	- Walking Statues of Waterdeep are a last resort - they may not act as expected once awakened and could cause more harm than good if it's too rash
	- Laeral told [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) - sent same message to Zelifarn multiple times with no response:
		> _Honored Zelifarn, mighty guardian of Waterdeepâ€™s depths, a great calamity approaches. The city burns without you. Stand with us, and protect your city._

	- Party took their leave to try to talk to Zelifarn

## Avalon and Harland Took Leave to talk to Zelifarn
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) cast Legend Lore on Zelifarn
	- Adult bronze dragon
	- Historically has not involved himself in conflict
	- He is friends with Blackstaffs - one in particular
		- They met and befriended him
	- Dragon did assist Neverwinter in the past with conflicts, but has not supported Waterdeep
	- He loves poetry, Blackstaffs, and human oddities
	- Vajra summoned a group to investigate him, at the time the adventurers scouted but some went back to help him because he was trying to investigate a submarine
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) and [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) teleported to the bottom of the bay to speak with Zelifarn
	- Appeared in an underwater cavern
	- Lots of debris around, various wood carvings, pieces of metal, etc.
	- We see a slumbering bronze dragon.
		- Dark tears coming out of its eyes and pooling underneath its lids
