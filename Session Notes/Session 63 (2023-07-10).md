#Unexpected-Wedding 
[Sylvia](Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Adriel]] confronted [[Sirbastien]]
	- Asked him what he put in [[Max]]'s drink
		- [[Sirbastien]] said he put a dose of mulberry concentrate into the wine in an attempt to ruin the night by making him pass out during the festivities
		- [[Adriel]] made an insight check (rolled 19) and believed he was being honest
		- [[Adriel]] made a medicine check (rolled 25) on the strength of the mulberry in the wine and determined that it wasn't concentrated enough to kill anyone
	- [[Adriel]] asked if [[Sirbastien]] knew of anyone who may have been "out to get" [[Max]]
		- [[Sirbastien]] couldn't really think of anyone, but said maybe [[Milton]] was tired of mistreatment from [[Max]]
		- [[Sirbastien]] said [[Max]] refused to engage or show etiquette to those he deemed "less"
- [[Adriel]] and [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) chatted
	- [[Adriel]] shared with her that he spoke to Dizzy and learned [[Sirbastien]] put the mulberry in the wine
	- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) shared that she learned [[Milton]] spiked the wine with silver lotus
	- [[Sirbastien]] approached and said he found a foot trail around the side of the lodge, asked if we wanted to go with him to investigate
	- [[Adriel]] said [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) had a hair out of place and she needed to GO UPSTAIRS and fix the hair (code for investigate upstairs)
- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) sneaking into the servant's quarters
	- Found trunks for servants including [[Milton]]'s
		- Tools hidden in the bottom of the chest - 2x slim daggers (one taken), leather pouch containing caltrops (taken), a set of thieves tools rolled up in leather cylinder (taken), 5 days of rations in organized boxes, crowbar
		- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) stole 1 dagger, the caltrops, and the thieves tools and locked them in her room
- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) gathered the others and suggested they regroup in her & [[Stalfor]]'s room
	- Discussed evidence and narrowed down suspects to [[Galianne]], [[Milton]], and [[Thalgion]]
	- [[Stalfor]] read dwarvish book from [[Adriel]], 
		- Someone has underlined several sections in one specific chapter
			- Describes different types of geological surveys centuries ago to determine their efficiency in detecting very good ore
			- Note in margin saying "If this is correct, mining here could be exceedingly lucrative"
			- Three surveys occurred around where Silver Lodge is located
				- Concluded gold, silver, and mithril could be mined in the area
- [[Adriel]] went back to investigate the outside of the door in the master suite, and noticed denting/splintering in the door at head level
	- Thought was that someone had smashed Max's head into the door before pushing him over the edge
	- [[Adriel]] noted that [[Milton]] and [[Lillian]] are yoked
	- [[Stalfor]] noted that [[Thalgion]] is yoked
- [[India]] spoke to [[Lysandrea]]
	- Suggested that [[Thalgion]] may be a suspect
	- [[Lysandrea]] wasn't confident that he would murder but [[Thalgion]] is strong, has a rapier
	- [[India]] peeked at [[Thalgion]]'s rapier and saw the hilt poking out from behind the long dinner jacket
		- Hilt was long flourish of silver forming a guard around the hand, fine gem on pommel, looks perfectly clean and incredibly well crafted (+2 rapier)
- Regrouped and shared info, decided to interrogate [[Milton]]
	- [[Adriel]] asked if [[Milton]] had seen [[Max]] around in the past 45 mins - 1 hour
		- He said he hasn't seen him but hasn't had time to look for him
		- [[Adriel]] on a 23 insight check determined he had looked for him but hadn't found him
		- [[Adriel]] revealed [[Max]] was murdered, wanted to insight check to see if his reaction was genuine but we ended the session
