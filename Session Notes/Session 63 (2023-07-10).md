- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) confronted [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md)
	- Asked him what he put in [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)'s drink
		- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) said he put a dose of mulberry concentrate into the wine in an attempt to ruin the night by making him pass out during the festivities
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) made an insight check (rolled 19) and believed he was being honest
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) made a medicine check (rolled 25) on the strength of the mulberry in the wine and determined that it wasn't concentrated enough to kill anyone
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) knew of anyone who may have been "out to get" [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
		- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) couldn't really think of anyone, but said maybe [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) was tired of mistreatment from [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)
		- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) said [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) refused to engage or show etiquette to those he deemed "less"
- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) and [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) chatted
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) shared with her that he spoke to Dizzy and learned [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) put the mulberry in the wine
	- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) shared that she learned [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) spiked the wine with silver lotus
	- [Sirbastien](NPCs/Living/Sirbastien.md) approached and said he found a foot trail around the side of the lodge, asked if we wanted to go with him to investigate
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) said [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) had a hair out of place and she needed to GO UPSTAIRS and fix the hair (code for investigate upstairs)
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) sneaking into the servant's quarters
	- Found trunks for servants including [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md)'s
		- Tools hidden in the bottom of the chest - 2x slim daggers (one taken), leather pouch containing caltrops (taken), a set of thieves tools rolled up in leather cylinder (taken), 5 days of rations in organized boxes, crowbar
		- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) stole 1 dagger, the caltrops, and the thieves tools and locked them in her room
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) gathered the others and suggested they regroup in her & [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md)'s room
	- Discussed evidence and narrowed down suspects to [Galianne](NPCs/Living/Galianne.md), [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md), and [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md)
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) read dwarvish book from [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md), 
		- Someone has underlined several sections in one specific chapter
			- Describes different types of geological surveys centuries ago to determine their efficiency in detecting very good ore
			- Note in margin saying "If this is correct, mining here could be exceedingly lucrative"
			- Three surveys occurred around where Silver Lodge is located
				- Concluded gold, silver, and mithril could be mined in the area
- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) went back to investigate the outside of the door in the master suite, and noticed denting/splintering in the door at head level
	- Thought was that someone had smashed Max's head into the door before pushing him over the edge
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) noted that [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) and [[Lillian]] are yoked
	- [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) noted that [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) is yoked
- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) spoke to [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md)
	- Suggested that [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) may be a suspect
	- [Lysandrea](NPCs/Living/Lysandrea.md) wasn't confident that he would murder but [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md) is strong, has a rapier
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) peeked at [Thalgion](NPCs/Deceased/Thalgion.md)'s rapier and saw the hilt poking out from behind the long dinner jacket
		- Hilt was long flourish of silver forming a guard around the hand, fine gem on pommel, looks perfectly clean and incredibly well crafted (+2 rapier)
- Regrouped and shared info, decided to interrogate [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md)
	- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) asked if [Milton](NPCs/Living/Milton.md) had seen [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) around in the past 45 mins - 1 hour
		- He said he hasn't seen him but hasn't had time to look for him
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) on a 23 insight check determined he had looked for him but hadn't found him
		- [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md) revealed [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) was murdered, wanted to insight check to see if his reaction was genuine but we ended the session
