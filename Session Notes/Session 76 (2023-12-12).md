#Canopic-Being 
[[Avalon]], [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Found a jar in an alcove that had a label of a book on it, this one was a pancreas.
	- Sword Jar had eye. [[Stalfor]] tried to stab it but it absorbed the blow of the mace and was unharmed.

	- Crystal Ball jar brain stem
		- [[Xemru]]
	- Hammer jar empty
		- [[Stalfor]]
	- Cat jar has beating heart

- Decided to open sarcophagus and a ward was triggered, [[Avalon]] dispelled the ward. Opened the sarcophagus and it was empty. Were met with laughing in our heads.
- [[India]] and [[Stalfor]] heard a booming voice in their heads saying the following. Sounds like same voice that spoke in all of our heads in this temple earlier:
	> _You've gotten quite adept at foiling the plans of those who would seek to do harm unto others, however you've left a few loose threads along your tapestry. A power vacuum in a cult, a tower turned rocket ship ready to take to the heavens again, a man who damned countless souls to hell left to the local law to deal with. It was humorous to see you collapse a demiplane a beholder sought to make its own. Something like that might cause the beholder to lash out - tragedy may befall any haunt of yours near a passage to the underdark left unguarded_

- Crossed sarcophagus chamber, entered new room, pyramid shaped. Door on slanted wall and door on floor level.
	- Saw a figure in the room floating around.
	- [[Stalfor]] heard a voice in his head trying to convince him to study with her using divination to further develop his artificer skillz
	- [[India]] heard a voice promising museums dedicated to her archaeology endeavors and the path there is via the divination sanctum

- Went to peek at slanty door, [[India]] and [[Avalon]] saw lots of motes of swirling light (eyeballs) turning to look 
- At apex of cube is a woman sitting in the air, wearing same yellow robes as everyone else (this is [Valin]])
- [[India]] entered room with [[Dr. Hoo]], room is floaty and she started flying.

- [[Avalon]] confirmed from [[Valin]] that she took her pancreas

- Started fight with [[Valin]], killed her. But to kill mummy lord we gotta destroy her heart? Heart jar?
