- Went into inner sanctum........

## Kossuth's Inner Sanctum
- Found [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) inside, appeared to have shed a lot of blood and resources
- He revealed that he had made a pact with Kossuth in exchange for power after he failed getting into the Blackstaff Academy
- When [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) returned from a contract with the amulet around her neck, he said he worried it would draw Kossuth out through his pact
- Worried about the amulet, [Rowan](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md) set off to the sanctum within Mount Hotenow to try to free himself from his pact
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) was upset with him for trying to protect her by not telling her the truth when they were together - said if he had been honest they could've faced it together
	- She insisted on helping him try to break his pact despite his pleas for her and her friends to leave the sanctum
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) trusted that his research was thorough and they started the ritual again
	- They recited some ritual together and he transformed into an avatar of Kossuth, now party is fighting Kossuth </3
