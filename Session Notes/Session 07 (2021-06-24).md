# Notes
- Freed a bunch of good yuan-ti, they told us there were two more in the temple
- In the temple we saw a large yuan-ti abomination (leader) and two others doing a ceremony to open a sarcophagus. Two "good" yuan-ti were chained to an altar
- We got a surprise round
- Fought the leader and killed them all, but [Basil](PCs/Past/Basil.md) died in the battle, when he died he reverted to his human form
- Afterwards grippli performed ceremony for the rest of us, woke up feeling refreshed (long rest) and knew the grippli language
- Planned to take his body to the temple of beauty/music stuff, hold funeral party at yawning portal with closed casket + open bar
