# Session 93 Notes
### Lykortha Expanse
- Killed the behir, Harland and Avalon Fly themselves above the fog
- In cages were all varied sorts of mutilated and rotten creatures
- Explored deeper in cave, found space with corpses with hole going down that reeked of decay
	- Sent chicken book over hole and made out edges of something, and felt a rumbling and then giant porpol worm appeared </3
	- Ran away from worm and found brown mold door, very cold
		- Decided to leave mold door and return later.
- Headed down another path and a bunch of fungal creatures attacked but we defeated them
