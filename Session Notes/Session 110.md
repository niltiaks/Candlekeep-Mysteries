# Session 110 Notes
## Blackstaff Tower
- Avalon went to the Tower to speak with Eldric
	- Fill him in on the Rowan situation from yesterday
	- Ask how much he's heard of the approaching calamity
	- I know we don't usually say this kind of thing but.. I need you to be safe. You've always had my back, always been there for me when I needed you. I want you to know how much that means to me. I don't know what I would do if I lost you. Probably go to the afterlife and drag you back myself. I love you.
- Speak with Rowan
	- I had a dream last night. Waterdeep was burning. My friends... you... were all gone. It made me realize I don't want to lose you and I don't want to leave things the way we did yesterday with what's coming. I just need time. So please be safe. Promise me you will try to survive this, so we can have the chance to figure things out after it's done.
