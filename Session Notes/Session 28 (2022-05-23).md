[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Past/India.md), [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Arrived at Triboar
	- Town looks mostly abandoned except for a patrol of three guards and two watchtowers at either end of town, with one guard in each
	- Went to the "Honourable Lute Tavern", run by a large elven woman, Jelenneth.
	- Orcs and other creatures showed up to town a few days prior and attacked, taking several people with them in cages.
		- Other creatures: Ogres? Maybe?
	- Investigating footprints in the mud on the main town road, we see one half-ogre set of prints mixed with lots of other prints
- Passed through Longsaddle. Restocked supplies. Town was able to fight off orc attacks, is mostly unscathed.
- Reached Mirabar - dwarven mining city near the foot of Kendricklamar Mountain.
- Arrived at Mirabar
	- Taverns, inns, temples, lots of thangs
	- Bought cold weather clothing + rations
	- [[Adriel]] put up carriage + horses at a stable
	- Set off on foot towards mountain

- Arrived at Khundrukar, snuck past some orcs and got to a bridge where India and [[Stalfor]] shoved a bunch off into a chasm
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) shot a big ogre boy and orc horns sounded off
