[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [India](PCs/Current/India.md), [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Explored the rest of the first floor, found a room with the following:
	- +1 rapier
	- ==210 gp
	- ==topaz worth 200 gp
	- ==2x onyx worth 50 gp each
	- ==300 gp from sacks
- Group name is officially the Skinny Legends
- Descended stairs into open area, slaves were mining and orcs attacked us
- Stonework in a lot of the tunnels and caves had lots smooth curves to the rock (flows like waves?)
- Party decided for [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) to shoot to make sound to draw in enemies:
	- Drew in a bunch of stirges, a few orcs, and a giant snapping turtle, killed them all
- Came across tomb that was intended to be final resting place of Durgeddin clan, tomb overlooks big cavern filled with fungus, paths weaving through it
- Party killed orcs in the cavern, some of the civvies mining were [[Stalfor]]'s parents!
- [[Stalfor]] reunited with them while [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) unlocked the manacles of the rest of the civilians
- [[Stalfor]]'s parents said they were going to set up a camp on the first floor, party decided to search rest of floor before taking a long rest (or trying to)
- Approached a door and two stone golem things jumped out of the wall and we killed them
- Ended session as we approached the door
