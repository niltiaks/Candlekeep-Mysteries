# Notes

- [Adriel](PCs/Past/Adriel.md) stole [Rosalinda](NPCs/Living/Rosalinda.md)'s purse, [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) clocked it
- Unsure if [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) was hit in the head before or after the fall from the balcony
- Couldn't find anything about the purse that indicated it may have been a murder weapon (no blunt objects inside that matched any of his wounds)
	- 1 gp, 2 sp, 6 cp, small pouch of dried lavender, 3 plain hairpins, large pendant/broach depicting some holy symbol with a large white diamond + blue star ([Adriel](PCs/Past/Adriel.md) recognizes the symbol)
- Searching Max's body:
	- well crafted/magic rapier
	- pouch with 11cp 
	- nice rings
	- under formal tunic wearing discreetly hidden elven chain shirt
- No stab wounds found
- Last time any of us saw [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) was when he danced with [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) (Dance 3)

	- Don't find any hidden entrances/trap doors
