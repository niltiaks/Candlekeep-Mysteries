# Session 103 Notes
## Mount Hotenow
- Fought elementals and mephits
	- The gargantuan elementals spoke Ignan, saying to each other:
	> _Bad wall, hurt, we wait_ :(
	
- Gargantuan elementals just dipped after we figured out a strategy to whoop their asses

### Entrance
- Shot fire bolts at the iron door at the end of the stone bridge to open it and entered the sanctum
- Obsidian floors and walls lined with gold
- Ignan symbols the door in front of us, it said "through fire, we bind the unquenchable"
- Walls had depictions of clerics and wizards taking down Kossuth, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) recognized it from her scrying a few days prior

### Ledger Hall
- Went through the first door, down a long hall to look at ledger
	- Notes of supply deliveries for the cultists (water, grains, etc)
	- Ledger goes back years and years
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) pocketed the ledger (put it in Stalfor's bag of holding)
- Heard chanting through both doors
- Went through left door

### Empty V-Hallway
- Chanting stopped as [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) entered the hallway
- Northern door was where the chanting was coming from
- Went through Northern door

### Dining Hall
- Heard cheerful humming to the left
- Chatter to the right, went to the right

### Cultist Room
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) changed his appearance to look like the cultist inquisitor we killed in Neverwinter and strolled into the room like it was nobody's mf business
	- Inquisitor's name was Dean Akton
- Octagonal room, center of room has raised grate with embers and smoke rising from it
- Northern wall lined with three doors
- South wall decorated with three murals
- Room FULLLLLL of cultists just chilling <3
- Dude in the back rose and asked "Inquisitor Akton" how his mission was going
	- He said they were accosted by their target and her party and that she is powerful but her companions were even more powerful LOL
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) asked for an update from them and they said they were still blocked off from the door
	- Said "[Arkenth](NPCs/Living/Rowan.md)" placed a ward on the door and they had no way of opening it.
	- Saw him for the first time when he arrived at the sanctum, he went through their studies, stole scrolls, and before they realized what he was doing, he had sealed the inner sanctum shut
- Inquisitor [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) said he would investigate the problem door.
