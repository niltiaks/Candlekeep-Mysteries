#FeywildArc 
[[Avalon]], [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Slates collected so far: ITRAPSONAI

#### Room 6
- Replica of Room 1
- Avalon dispelled the light on the orb and lit up some torches to protect from shadows around them
- Defeated some shadows and a staircase was revealed 

#### Room 7
- Replica of Room 2
- Pieced together that the slabs said "aspiration" and a portal appeared, the slabs vanished

#### Room 8
- Room with big pool
- Found two potions of supreme healing
- Pool itself radiated evocation magic, Avalon stepped in and gained the benefits of a long rest
	- The rest of the party followed suit
- Went down the stairs at the back of the room

#### Room 9
- Stairs lead to dirt path
- Stink of decay
- Adriel's home appeared but much more decayed
	- Walls collapsed in and covered in dirt, mud, or just rotted away
- Avalon detected illusory magic
- Crevice running through the home (5ft. wide gap) that has split the house and the ground
	- A root caused the crevice
	- A green/black ichor seeps from the root and along it
- Started to follow the root, about 60 feet away we started to make out a root going to a larger tree
	- Root is connected to a great, hollowed out stump
	- In front of the tree are three figures:
		- Two humanoid shapes, one in druidic leathers, one in platemail, a four legged beast
		- Oh no they are evil clones!!!
- Defeated the evil clones and the room illusion faded to reveal a room

#### Room 10
- Descended, the more we descended the more we got some fresh air
- Found ourselves at the near the top of a mountain
	- Carved steps going upward.
	- Climbed to peak of mountain
		- Starry sky cool space yeah
		- Four pillars and an altar
	- Adriel crafted a Ring of Celestial Alloy with Stalfor's guidance, Adriel renamed it [[Mungan]]'s Blessing, after his son
