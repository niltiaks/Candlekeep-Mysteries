#Unexpected-Wedding 
[Sylvia](Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Adriel]] just revealed to [[Milton]] that [[Max]] was potentially murdered
	- [[Milton]]'s reaction was to jump to his feet
	- We asked for his whereabouts during the time of the murder and he said he was busy coming and going from the kitchen, tending to the guests
	- [[Milton]] said he worried something bad had happened to [[Max]] when he couldn't find him, he said he felt like he failed [[Max]]
	- Told [[Milton]] we thought it was him because:
		- [[Max]] treats him poorly
		- Murderer needed to be someone strong enough to overpower [[Max]]
		- No alibi
		- [[Rosalinda]]'s purse planted on the body, which he may have had time to find and then use to frame [[Rosalinda]]
		- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) pointed out [[Milton]]'s tools
			- He said they were mere keepsakes, they were part of his past that he can't seem to leave behind
			- He said he lived on the street as a child, abandoned and neglected by his parents, said he worked as a Charlatan in Northwind Gate, crossed some of the wrong people and was forced to flee, from there he stole a footman's outfit and sought out a servant's job in a smaller town
			- Turns out he was good at his job (serving) and he didn't hate it
			- Insight checks (19 and 20) seemed shaky based on what we know but he seems genuine in the way he speaks
			- Said [[Max]]'s mistreatment bothers him but is tolerable because they provide him with a lovely lifestyle
		- [[Milton]] said [[Rosalinda]] is suspicious
			- Because her dialect matches the orphanage where he grew up. 
			- He saw her casting a warlock ritual once, its possible she did it as an act of service for her patron?
				- Ritual before was she was off on a strange path, someone speaking foreign language through her, sitting in a ring of mushrooms with a strange light around her
	- Brought in [[Rosalinda]] for questioning
		- Asked her if [[Adriel]] could borrow her idol to try to communicate with [[Titania]]
			- [[Adriel]] had a vision of a tree in a grove with a shelf/pocket in the center, asked if [[Rosalinda]] was sent to murder [[Max]] because of the mining operation
				- A letter was in the pocket, as he read it he heard her voice saying "No, I did not send Rosalinda to murder"
			- [[Adriel]] asked if she had any guidance since the religious symbol was so close to [[Max]]'s body
				- Tree shimmered and shook, a lightning bolt shot down and cracked the tree, ground opened up and swallowed him
		- She said it was near the beginning of the dance when she noticed it missing, she had left it on a chair or table and during her dance with India it was snatched
	- Brought in [[Thalgion]]
		- Lied about his whereabouts during dance 1, said he was with [[Charlotte]] but she said she was on the side enjoying [[Evelyn]]'s company
		- [[Adriel]] commanded him and he revealed he was stealing Rosalinda's purse during that dance
		- Things escalated and [[Thalgion]] demanded a duel for his honour
- [[Thalgion]] fought [[India]] and won
- Accused [[Thalgion]] of the murder and restrained him
	- Party was given 1000 gp (we split it evenly, 250gp each)
	- [[India]] was given her fancy bracers <3
- [Sylvia](Sylvia.md) apologized to [[Milton]] and he was very receptive and understanding given the circumstances, said he respects Sylvia and understood why she did what she did
- [[Adriel]] tried to resurrect [[Max]] the next day, 1000gp sponsored by his family, but it failed
