# Notes
- Found note tucked into the Canopic Being book:
> _Author’s Note_
> 
> _When we began this journey, only the oracle of the All-Seeing Orb, the great Valin Sarnaster, had an inkling where it might lead. It is my honor to have been selected as the first donor and recipient. By giving Valin a piece of myself and receiving a piece of her in return, I can help the fate of the world unfold as she has foreseen._ 
> 
> _It is my honor to protect the oracle in her sanctuary, ensuring that only donors and recipients may visit her. I have no need of the rite of reclamation, for I believe in the vision and perfection of Valin Sarnaster._
> 
> _For clarity's sake, I offer this record of the procedures performed on the donors and recipients, whose fates and organs are now bound to the oracle. May she serve the All-Seeing for centuries to come._
> 
> _In transparency,
> Xemru Thaal, High Priest of Savras
> House of the All-Seeing Orb, Tashluta_

- Party entered the temple, many people in yellow robes with third eyes tattooed onto their foreheads
- Met a priest named [Shir](NPCs/Living/Shir.md) Endellion who said [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) arrived a day prior and hasn't returned, [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) was escorted to Valin's sanctum
- Said [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md) is [Valin](NPCs/Deceased/Valin.md)'s highest/most trusted assistant, and does most of Valin's communicating
- Valin stays in her sanctum and lets Alessia run things so that she isn't bothered too often
- Said Xemru was part of a council, visited Valin 8 months ago and hasn't returned
	- Said Xemru abandoned their life outside of Valin's demiplane and chose to live with her
- Two others have gone missing, Zeren Zoradius (human mage) and Okuzor (tiefling gladiator)

- [Shir](NPCs/Living/Shir.md) took them to the demiplane, which they entered through a portal hidden inside a garden shed
- [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md) warned them against hall of mirrors, testing chamber, and phasing hall
- Were greeted by [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md) Baseer, who knew they were coming
	- [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md) told them they were fated to be there, that [Valin](NPCs/Deceased/Valin.md) was waiting for them. Gave them free reign of the sanctum
	- [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md) said she didn't know where Avalon went after she arrived yesterday

- Party entered the sanctum, found [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) very quickly
- After some debate about the next steps they decided to confront [Valin](NPCs/Deceased/Valin.md) so [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) led them the way she remembered and they had to fight the big crystal constructs
- Heard a booming voice arrogantly proclaiming we couldn't break into sarcophagus
- Defeated the constructs.
- Is [Valin](NPCs/Deceased/Valin.md) in the sarcophagus?? Unsure
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) definitely has her skin, brain, heart, and lungs
