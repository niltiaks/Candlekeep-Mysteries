# Session 94 Notes
### Lykortha Expanse
- Entered chamber with a stone staircase descending into clear center area, with murals of animals and fey creatures depicted in fungal forms (moss, mushrooms, etc)
	- Chamber is about 10 feet down
	- Murals maybe indicated they were [Sylvaranth](NPCs/Deceased/Aerryn.md)'s space for peace and meditation
		- Mural was nauseating to look at (bright colours and patterns)
		- Murals show Zuggtmoy and their relation to 222nd layer of the Abyss (Shedaklah)
			- Bogs, foggy moors, no sun, stars, or moon, and often overcast
			- Clouds were shit brown or booger green
			- Very humid and moist
	- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) fire bolted the murals to destroy them
- Found kitchen behind yellow mold door
	- Chittering of rats
	- Found a book with doodles of [Thunderwing](NPCs/Living/Thunderwing.md) and Bunnyblossom playing and having fun in a cute way in the margins of the text
	- Book seemed to be a recipe book, with recipes bookmarked for a mushroom soup and bread using a yeast unfamiliar to India
- Found another room behind a door, door was much less moldy
	- Room was moldy and mildew-y
	- White, thorned vines and purple flowers along walls and floor, emitting a faint glow
	- Dozens of large seed pods illuminating the area, could see the shadow of a sprite/pixie in the pods. All pods appeared occupied.
	- Armour possessed by something fungal came to life along with a bundle of vines having an eyeball... Harland cooked the vines and the rest of us destroyed the armour
	- Investigated the pods, they all looked like clones of Thunderwing. WTF
		- Asked [Thunderwing](NPCs/Living/Thunderwing.md) where baby sprites come from, she said "mommy sprite" and "daddy sprite"
			- Suspected there were sprites in the other room (there were, we lied) and vaguely remembered that [Sylvaranth](NPCs/Deceased/Aerryn.md) experimented on her for something. Took something from her and put it back...
			- Recalled entries in [Sylvaranth](NPCs/Deceased/Aerryn.md)'s journal about using the abilities of outsiders to regenerate in their plane as a potential source of magic. Thinks there may be a way to harness the power of fey magic from a fairy circle or similar to grow a regenerate a cloning plane and make more Thunderwings
- New alcove
	- Stagnant pool of water with glowing green algae and bioluminescant fish 
	- Oak leaf with  image of Sylvanus  etched into one of the walls
	- Took a short rest, Harland read out a second verse for his song. That was bars.
- Went back to cold mold door
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) and chicken went in
	- Scent of decay, horrifying botanical growth
	- India and chicken went down the hall, found room with [Sylvaranth](NPCs/Deceased/Aerryn.md) doing something to a deer carcass, an excited and curious boy in a cage?
	- My plan next time: either dimension door india out, dimension door two of us in, or Feeblemind [Sylvaranth](NPCs/Deceased/Aerryn.md)
