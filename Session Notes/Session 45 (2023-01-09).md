- Gift appeared in tub and gift tag got smudged, don't know what it said
	- Inside was a sopping set of glamoured studded leather
	- Everyone else also had gifts magically appear
- "Ruby Eyes" proposed some sort of business venture with [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md)imillian D'arlington to open a mine in protected lands
- [Max](NPCs/Deceased/Max.md) lives in Buckbridge in the Buckwild region

- Left [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md)'s and went to [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md)'s library
	- [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) was away, but we met his husband [[Duke]]
	- [[Duke]] gave us our reward (300gp each)

- [[Duke]] then asked if we could try to open a padlocked book titled "Zikran's Zephyrean Tome"
	- No one's been able to open it even with magic and great strength.
	- Chime of Opening didn't work
	- [[Duke]] told us Zikran is a water genasi wizard but they couldn't tell if he was alive or dead
		- He been trying to build a floating castle fortress
	- [[Duke]] said he'd pay us to open the book and find out what happened to Zikran
	- The book has marble leather binding and metal padlock
	- Edges of pages are worn and discoloured due to age
	- [India](PCs/Current/India.md) blew air into the lock and it opened, and a bunch of smoke came out of the lock in the form of a giant head
		- The head said his name was Gazre-Azam
		- Said he was trapped and asked if we were going to be the ones to help him
		- Said he was heir to last ruler of Akaa (elemental plane of air) and he has been trapped for about 10 years.
		- He was summoned for his knowledge on building elemental devices by the wizard Zikran, but was tricked and bound to the book
		- Only way to free him is for Zikran to end the enchantment willingly or for Zikran to be killed
		- Gazre-Azam told us that Zikran had a seaside laboratory
			- Follow Sword Coast south for 2 nights and a day until you find a spire made of coral
			- Stand at base of spire and look inland and we should see mouth of flooding cave. This cave leads to lab
			- Depending on tides the entrance to lab may be submerged underwater
			- Gazre-Azam was unsure if the cave entrance was guarded or not
