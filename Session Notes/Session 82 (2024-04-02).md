#FeywildArc 
[[Avalon]], [India](PCs/Past/India.md), [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- Court of Summer:
	- Grove of ancient trees with stairways up and around them
	- People within the court live in different parts of the the trees
	- On forest floor is a festival in full swing with satyrs, faeries, gnomes, etc
		- Tables laid out with various feasts
		- Bands playing music
		- Feywild games
	- Followed [[Adriel]] up, tried to eavesdrop on folks around to see if they were talking about the blight at all
	- Made it near her court room, gnome greeted us, named [[Pingle]] with a mirror smooth head and moustache 
		- Said we needed appointment so [[Adriel]] made one, didn't give [[Pingle]] his/our name(s)
	- Waited silently for appointment

- Meeting [[Titania]]
	- Elven woman with nearly blinding golden radiance about her
	- Faeries flying around with trays of lush food
	- Queen [[Titania]] is a fucking BADDIE
	- Gave [[Adriel]] a bombastic side eye
		- Passed a WIS save, felt some sort of charming effect just from her presence alone
	- [[Adriel]] asked [[Titania]] how could she let this happen, and she was basically like how dare you. I protect my court (those inside the court, outskirts not so much)
	- She said she wouldn't protect anyone outside of her court
	- It was clear she was very pompous and uncaring for those beneath her

- Left the throne room
	- [[Oberon]]
	- [[Damh]], patron of Satyrs
	- [[Ichthygurn]] unicorns pegasi
	- [[Squilaesh]] 
	- Idk I lost them all as Sam was reading them
	- Either way, Adriel couldn't see any of them around

- Asked folks around the court about whether they knew anything of the blight 
	- Most seemed unknowing or said why would they leave
	- Festival had been going on for several weeks
	- [India](PCs/Past/India.md) noticed some people frozen in place, maybe they were illusory?
	- [[Adriel]] suggested massive illusions/charms in place
	- [[Adriel]] said it might not be a bad idea to try to find the other members of the court
		- [[Oberon]], unusually tall muscular dude
			- Famously wears cloak of green leaves stitched onto leather
		- Went back up into trees to look for the apartments of the court members
		- Acted like we belonged (smile and wave boys)
	- Found satyr lesser deity of music, [[Damh]]
		- Said a blight had been placed on the Tree of Life
		- Said [[Titania]] is too proud to ask for help but also isn't sure who to ask
		- [[Oberon]] is out in the wilds trying to fix it himself
		- Other lords have gone to their own domains trying to help their people where they can
		- Said [[Ronorin]] was the one who placed the blight and his name has been stricken from the Court
		- Said there might be an artifact which boosts your connection to nature that could be used to remove the blight
		- Blessed us so long as we pledge ourselves to the Summer Court

- Set off into the Feywild, following the North Star to try to find this artifact
- Got caught up in a bunch of treants/undead trees but killed them
