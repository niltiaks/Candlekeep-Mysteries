# Session 109 Notes
## Zelifarn's Sea Cavern
- Inky black tears streaming from his eyes and down his snout
- Shadows coiling all around dragon, shaping themselves into visions in the darkness
	- Dragon clutching its horde as the horde turns to dust
	- Dark tides of a black sea rising and dragging the dragon deep underwater 
	- Dragon peering up at a storm flying overhead at the skeletal dragons
	- Figure in plate mail with skeletal wings holding greatsword, and a hand outstretched towards the dragon
- Harland countercharmed, but shadows coalesced into figures
- Fought the shadows, Harland's spirit guardians cooked them
- Saw a figure of Vitari, but he vanished as Avalon investigated to see if it was an illusion
- Harland played a little ditty to wake up Zelifarn, it woke him up
- It was low key very easy to convince him to help Waterdeep, he gave us a ride to the surface (we had to grip on very rightly)
	- Flew over city, saw an aerial view of soldiers setting up their bases around the city. 
	- Asked Zelifarn to fly us to Castle Waterdeep
- Zelifarn flew us to the castle, transformed into a bronze dragon and said he wanted to rest before battle tomorrow

## Castle Waterdeep
- Told Laeral that we recruited the dragon
- Laeral offered the party positions as Lords of Waterdeep
- Said to come back tomorrow
- Party went to YP for a drink

## Yawning Portal
- Durnan already in his half plate
- YP is busier than it was even during Harland's concert
- Durnan pulled out a special brew for the night since it may be the last for the city if the battle doesn't go well </3
	- Eldritch Bane - for later - more resistant to necrotic damage
	- Hill Giants gut punch
- Harland did a Heroes' Feast - lasts 24 hours
- India and Durnan FADE TO BLACK FINALLY.................................................
- All went to bed, took a long rest and all had nightmares, this was Avalon's:
	- You stand at the heart of Waterdeep, a city you have sworn to protect. Now, you see it in ruin. Before you, Blackstaff Tower has collapsed. Its once-proud spire shattered, its stones half-sunken into the earth like the broken bones of a dying beast. You look up. There, atop the ruined city walls, impaled by a blackened spear, is Vajra. Her body hangs limp, her dark robes whipped by the wind. Beneath her, the Blackstaff itself lies in pieces, its magic scattered to dust. Your eyes continue along the wall, past many corpses of your fellow mages. Your dearest friends—Eldric, Lucius, and Rowan—lay motionless in the rubble. Their hands outstretched, as if reaching for something they could not grasp. Their faces scorched and almost unrecognizable. A tremor shakes your core.
	- A whisper of wind scatters ash past your feet. And suddenly— You stand in Goldenfields, your childhood home peaceful under a sunlit sky. But the rolling fields are gone, burnt to nothing, the great abbey crumbled to cinders. The orchards, the laughter of farmers, the warmth of home—erased. The land is now barren and grey, a field of nothing but ash. A gust of wind kicks up the dust, choking the air. You cough and sputter and as you reach for something—anything— you find yourself somewhere else.
	- You wake with a start, but the air is calm. No fire. No screams. Only the soft morning light spilling through the windows of your wizard’s tower. A gentle rustling stirs behind you. As you sit up, a dark-haired man shifts under the covers, turning over with a contented sigh. His warmth lingers beside you as you quietly slip out of bed. Descending the tower’s spiral staircase, you step into a quaint village, its stone cottages and market stalls bustling with life. The scent of fresh baked bread and blooming flowers greets you. Children laugh and chase each other through the streets, their carefree joy so utterly foreign to the life you have known. At a small bookshop, you run your fingers along the spine of a well-loved tome, breathing in the scent of parchment. A farmer passes, offering you a small basket of fresh-picked berries, their sweetness bursting on your tongue. The man lifts the brim of his straw hat, his golden eyes glinting in the sunlight. Vitari. His voice is smooth, assured, undeniable. "Join me, and this future is yours to seize."

- Were woken up in the middle of the night, after dreams, by bells ringing through city
- Looks like maybe a storm is approaching 
- Met with Harland, India, Durnan in the hall. Decided to head to Castle Waterdeep.
- As we were heading downstairs, someone was knocking at the door to the YP.
	- Watch Lord Ralsta Norn with some members of the City Guard.
	- She speaks with Durnan in hushed tones before quickly departing.
- Durnan turns back to the tavern and announced that Waterdeep was the victim of a False Alarm - the alarm bells all went off at the same time in the middle of the night
	- A tactic to throw us off or shake us?
	- Enemy is not yet here - but continue to be vigilant.
- Avalon cast Sending to Stalfor to let him know that the bells were a false alarm, to get some rest

# Next Day
## Salvatore Firearm Company
- India, Stalfor, and Orianna went to SFC to get some stuff from Salvatore
- On the way, heard of people trying to convince others that Vitari is a god, calling themselves the Empty Choir
- Salvatore greeted them at the door and invited them in to the manor
- Got treats from Salvatore <3
