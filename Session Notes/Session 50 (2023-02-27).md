# Notes
- [Adriel](Adriel.md) healed up the party before descending the stairs
- In the room down the stairs there was a lot of giant-sized furniture with the exception of a human-sized bed and human-sized desk
- In the middle of the room was an 8-ft. tall crystal causing the thunder and lightning crackles
- Zikran standing next to the crystal, guarded by two elementals
- Zikran said he wanted the book to use Gazre-Azam to turn it into a flying fortress to take into battle but the Skinny Legends refused
- Fought Zikran, freed Gazre-Azam and [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md) used the promised wish to restore Khundrukar (not Phandalin?) and for a place to live for his family and the towns inhabitants
- Found some treasure:
	- 5x pearls worth 100 gp each
	- 4x pouches of diamond dust worth 100 gp each
	- Crystal ball
