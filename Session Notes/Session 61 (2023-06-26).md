#Unexpected-Wedding 
[Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md), [[India]], [[Stalfor]], [[Adriel]]

- [[Rosalinda]] and [[Adriel]] had a chat
	- [[Rosalinda]] said she overheard snippets of a conversation between some people, wasn't sure who they were, sounded hostile
		- "... Should talk to..."
		- "... You will regret it..."
		- "... No one knows about..."
	- Carries a symbol of [[Titania]] in her purse bc it's her way of communicating with ✨someone✨ who is flawlessly beautiful
		- Sometimes carries out "harmless" favours for her
		- This someone has wings, long flowing beautiful hair, with lush leaves and plants interwoven in. Long beautiful dress, carries a wand
		- [[Adriel]] knew this was [[Titania]] but didn't share that he knew who it was, he played dumb
	- [[Adriel]] crit failed an insight check (still was a 10) when [[Rosalinda]] said she didn't know much about the D'arlington curse
	- Said it seems like [[Titania]] gave her a "break" to enjoy the wedding
- [[India]] talking to [[Rita]]
	- Said she was enjoying the music during the dance
	- Thought the music during Dance 5 was stuffy, said she excused herself for some refreshments during that one
	- Said she didn't want to say anything too negative about Max but said he was definitely a "type"
	- Said Sirbastien seems "haunted" (low on spirits)
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) talking to [[Evelyn]] and [[Charlotte]]
	- Ask how they enjoyed the dance
		- [[Charlotte]] said [[Thalgion]] danced with her for Dance 1
		- [[Charlotte]] danced with [[Galianne]]
		- [[Evelyn]] didn't dance with anyone, said the wine is all she needs
	- By any chance did they see Max after he finished dancing with [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md)
		- They said [[Max]] disappeared into the lodge after [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md)'s dance with him
		- [[Charlotte]] asked Sylvia to send Max to her if she finds him
- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) searched what she believed to be [[Thalgion]]'s room
	- Found lockbox
		- Jewellery
		- Pins and broaches
		- Journal
			- Most notes are about his plans for each day, to-do lists, etc.
			- Some poetry 
			- Wood elven court gossip
				- Might be some fey playing tricks on some of the messengers with scrambling messages before they are received
				- Might be a scandalous love affair between high ranking noble and forbidden paramour
			- Ambassador to high elven court had been lying and betrayed some sort of deal
			- Entries from a while ago (years) mention that [[Thalgion]] has a crush on [[Lysandrea]]
				- He thinks that their relation is distant enough that it would be fine
				- Disproves of [[Galianne]] marrying a human and thinks that a marriage between himself and [[Lysandrea]] would build trust back in the court
			- Later entries talk about him presenting this idea to Lysandrea and he got rejected
			- Burst of entries recently about wedding invite, seemed like he hadn't known about any sort of engagement between Lysandrea and anyone prior to that
				- Despite having to hide that he is ardently in love with [[Lysandrea]] he is going to attempt one more time to convince her to "follow the true path"
	- As [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) was getting ready to leave, she heard [[Thalgion]] approaching his room
		- [Sylvia](PCs/Past/Sylvia.md) hid under the bed successfully with both glasses of wine while [[Thalgion]] touched up his fragrance and left
- [[Stalfor]] talking to [[Lysandrea]]
	- [[Stalfor]] asked if she knew of anyone who may have had it out for [[Max]]
		- Says even though she doesn't want to believe it but confirmed that [[Galianne]] did have a thing with [[Max]]
		- Concerned that [[Max]] may have had something over [[James]] B considering how much free entertainment he provides the family
		- Admitted that [[Thalgion]] did approach her with an "offer" some time ago, said not to discount him as a suspect
		- Said [[Rosalinda]] was missing from the dancefloor most of the night but doesn't think she's capable of murder
- [[Adriel]] talking to [[Lysandrea]] and [[Stalfor]]
	- Wine was likely placed in their room after afternoon activities but before dance
	- A gentleman named Robert Markham, young half-elf, wearing dull violet blouse with black pants, may have been the one to drop the wine off at their room
	- [[Lysandrea]] said she did have feelings for [[Sirbastien]] but they agreed to put their feelings aside for their families, she needed to marry the heir to the wealth
	- [[Stalfor]] brought up mining to [[Lysandrea]], this was stressful news
	- Doesn't think that [[Sirbastien]] would be capable of murder
	- Said she would talk to [[Galianne]] to try to get more info like where folks were during dances
