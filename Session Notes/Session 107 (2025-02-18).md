# Session 107 Notes
## Onvyr's Library
- Wielder of Blackrazor is making MOVES
	- Leads a force hundreds of thousands strong, marching onto Waterdeep
	- Dark cloud following them - might be a flying citadel
	- The Lords of Waterdeep are meeting tonight
- [Duke](NPCs/Living/Duke.md): 
>	_"Shit's fucked, we gotta go"_
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) does not trust Blackstaffs

## Travel To Meeting
- Lots of commotion in the streets - doesn't seem frantic as of yet
- Hearing rumours spread of a war coming
- Many people heading to North Gate and out, rumours suggest conflict is coming from the South
- Makeshift aid camp in alleys, for refugees arriving to the city
- Baker handing out free bread to all passersby
- Sign further in Trades Ward at Blacksmith's shop - weapons out of stock, good luck
- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) playing music, seems to calm people in the streets as the party passes by

## Castle Waterdeep Council Hall

- Basically LOTS of bickering at the table, [Laeral](Laeral.md) gained control of the room
	- Three days before they reach the city
	- Wielder of Blackrazor comes as a god-thing of stolen power
	- Scouts confirmed he arrives on a floating fortress
	- Paths:

		- Fight, rally allies beyond these walls
			- Enter the floating citadel to defeat the Blackrazor wielder
	- Closes the meeting by asking for volunteers for people to strike the floating citadel

- Meeting adjourned, people start conversing in the council hall
- Discussed with [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) and [Duke](NPCs/Living/Duke.md)
	- Flying/teleporting in now not a good idea obviously lol
	- Said Harpers have spies, who might be able to divulge more information
	- [Harland](PCs/Current/Harland.md) very hesitant, left the council hall to the streets.

- [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) approached [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md), who was arguing with Jarlaxl to subtly offer to pay his mercenaries
	- [Onvyr](NPCs/Living/Onvyr.md) and [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) have a discussion about how he and his scholars can best support her and her mages
	- Talking about wards and evocation spells, etc
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) joined the conversation, explained to [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) she and her current adventuring party were going to form the strike team, but would also gladly offer her services to the Blackstaff wizards in any way necessary
	- [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) agreed [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) should be part of the strike team, and would call for her aid with the other wizards if needed.

- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) cast sending to [Adriel](PCs/Past/Adriel.md): 
	> _Waterdeep faces annihilation in three days, Blackrazor-wielding god leads hundreds of thousands, need your power against their flying fortress. Please help, old friend._
- [Adriel](PCs/Past/Adriel.md) replied:
	> _Seelie court struggles against unseelie court, what do you need?_
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) cast again, saying:
	> _Nature's radiant fury could help destroy their dracoliches and weaken their fortress. Even brief aid could save thousands. Please help._
- [Adriel](PCs/Past/Adriel.md) replied:
	> _In your hour of need, spirits of the dire wolves will grant you aid_
- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) cast again, saying:
	> _Thank you._

- Draco-liches vulnerability to radiant
- Automatons described on the map looked like the cockroach-bodied, dog-headed constructs we saw in Candlekeep

- [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md) spoke with [Laeral](Laeral.md) and [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md)
	- Has not been able to figure out how to put a team into the fortress
	- [Vajra](NPCs/Living/Vajra.md) said there were the ancient flying cities of Netheril
		- Disable the flying citadel, have it crash into the legions on the ground
		- High Netheril, when it was forged, was ruined in a matter of hours
		- Sought to fuse the weave with Shadowfell which brought down the city
