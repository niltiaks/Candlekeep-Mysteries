- Wood elven male
- [[Sylvia]]'s family hired Charles as caretaker for her and her brother as children
- Once the children were old enough to care for themselves, he was promoted to head of staff for the Reid manor and is treated like family by the Reids ([Salvatore](NPCs/Living/Salvatore.md), [[Evelyn]], [Caspian](NPCs/Living/Caspian.md)).
- Comes from the same wood elf clan as [[India]], and they are good childhood friends. (Maybe more??) Still besties :)
