# Valin Sarnaster
- Was a renowned divination wizard
- Created her own demiplane where she was turning herself into a mummy by stealing organs from "willing" sacrifices (most were not willing)
- Stole [Avalon](PCs/Current/Avalon.md)'s pancreas but the party ([India](PCs/Current/India.md), [Stalfor](PCs/Current/Stalfor.md), [Adriel](PCs/Current/Adriel.md)) rescued her and killed Valin.
- Most trusted assistant was [Alessia](NPCs/Living/Alessia.md)
