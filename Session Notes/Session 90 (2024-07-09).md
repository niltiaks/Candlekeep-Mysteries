		- Avalon asked the cleric (Lewis) about the pandemic:
			- He said it's been going on for months, doesn't know what city it started in
			- Said it's best to just stay inside and only go out for necessities even if they are hard to come by
			- Avalon offered to get her wizard friends who are able to teleport conjured supplies to their temple
			- He gave her a few face coverings and they headed to Onvyr's Library

- Onvyr's library had stone windows and an arcane eye which greeted the party, he invited the party inside and ended the session.
